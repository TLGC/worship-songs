Verse 1
When the mountains fall and the tempest roars
You are with me
When creation folds
Still my soul will soar on Your mercy

Pre-Chorus
I'll walk through the fire with my head lifted high
And my spirit revived in Your story
And I'll look to the cross as my failure is lost
In the light of Your glorious grace

Chorus
So let the ruins come to life
In the beauty of Your Name
Rising up from the ashes
God forever You reign
And my soul will find refuge
In the shadow of Your wings
I will love You forever and forever I'll sing

Verse 2
When the world caves in
Still my hope will cling to Your promise
Where my courage ends
Let my heart find strength in Your presence

Pre-Chorus
I'll walk through the fire with my head lifted high
And my spirit revived in Your story
And I'll look to the cross as my failure is lost
In the light of Your glorious grace

Chorus (2x)
So let the ruins come to life
In the beauty of Your Name
Rising up from the ashes
God forever You reign
And my soul will find refuge
In the shadow of Your wings
I will love You forever and forever I'll sing

Interlude
Oh oh
Oh oh

Chorus (3x)
Let the ruins come to life
In the beauty of Your Name
Rising up from the ashes
God forever You reign
And my soul will find refuge
In the shadow of Your wings
I will love You forever and forever I'll sing

Interlude
Oh oh
Oh oh

Pre-Chorus
I'll walk through the fire with my head lifted high
And my spirit revived in Your story
And I'll look to the cross as my failure is lost
In the light of Your glorious grace
