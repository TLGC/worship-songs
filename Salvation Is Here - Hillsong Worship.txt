God above all the world in motion
God above all my hopes and fears
I don't care what the world throws at me now
It's gonna be alright

Hear the sound of the generations
Making loud our freedom song
All in all that the world would know Your name
It's gonna be alright

CHORUS
'Cause I know my God saved the day
And I know His word never fails
And I know my God made a way for me
Salvation is here
