There's nothing worth more
that would ever come close,
No thing can compare,
You're our living Hope,
Your presence, Lord

I've tasted and seen
of the sweetest of loves,
When my heart becomes free
and my shame is undone,
Your presence, Lord

Holy Spirit You are welcome here,
Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere.
Your glory God is what our hearts long for,
To be overcome by Your presence, Lord
Your presence Lord
