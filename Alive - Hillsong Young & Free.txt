VERSE 1
I was lost with a broken heart
You picked me up now I'm set apart
From the ash I am born again
Forever safe in the Saviour's hands

VERSE 2
You are more than my words could say
I'll follow You Lord for all my days
Fix my eyes follow in Your ways
Forever free in unending grace

PRE-CHORUS
'Cause You are, You are, You are
My freedom
We lift You higher, lift You higher
Your love, Your love, Your love
Never ending

CHORUS
You are alive in us
Nothing can take Your place
You are all we need
Your love has set us free

VERSE 3
In the midst of the darkest night
Let Your love be the shining light
Breaking chains that were holding me
You sent Your Son down and set me free

VERSE 4
Everything of this world will fade
I'm pressing on 'till I see Your face
I will live that Your will be done
I won't stop till Your kingdom come

PRE-CHORUS
'Cause You are, You are, You are
My freedom
We lift You higher, lift You higher
Your love, Your love, Your love
Never ending

CHORUS
You are alive in us
Nothing can take Your place
You are all we need
Your love has set us free

CHORUS
You are alive in us
Nothing can take Your place
You are all we need
Your love has set us free

TAG
You are, You are, You are my freedom
We lift You higher, lift You higher
Your love, Your love, Your love never ending
Oh oh oh

CHORUS
You are alive in us
Nothing can take Your place
You are all we need
Your love has set us free

CHORUS
You are alive in us
Nothing can take Your place
You are all we need
Your love has set us free
