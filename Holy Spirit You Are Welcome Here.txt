VERSE 1
There's nothing worth more that would ever come close,
No thing can compare, You're our living Hope,
Your presence, Lord.

VERSE 2
I've tasted and seen of the sweetest of loves,
When my heart becomes free and my shame is undone,
Your presence, Lord.

CHORUS
Holy Spirit You are welcome here,
Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere.
Your glory God is what our hearts long for,
To be overcome by Your presence, Lord.
The presence Lord
