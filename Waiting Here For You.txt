VERSE 1
If faith can move the mountains
Let the Mountains move
We come with expectation
Waiting here for You,
Waiting here for You

VERSE 2
You're the Lord of all creation
And still You know my heart
The Author of salvation
You've loved us from the start

CHORUS
Waiting here for You
With our hands lifted high in praise
And it's You we adore
Singing Hallelujah

VERSE 3
You are everything You promised
Your faithfulness is true
And we're desperate for Your presence
All we need is You

CHORUS
Waiting here for You
With our hands lifted high in praise
And it's You we adore
Singing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

BRIDGE
Singing Hallelujah,
Hallelujah

CHORUS (2x)
Waiting here for You
With our hands lifted high in praise
And it's You we adore
Singing Hallelujah
