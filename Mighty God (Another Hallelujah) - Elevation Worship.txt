VERSE 1
The wind is watching every gesture of Your hand
Waves of fear collapse at Your command
I know tomorrow when the pressure rushes in
You'll be there to rescue me again

CHORUS
What a mighty God, what a mighty God, You are
What a mighty God, what a mighty God, You are

VERSE 2
Here in Your presence there will be no other throne
All my heart is Yours and Yours alone
The song of heaven and my soul will sing the same
Jesus Christ, the name above all names

CHORUS
What a mighty God, what a mighty God, You are
What a mighty God, what a mighty God, You are
What a mighty God, what a mighty God, You are
What a mighty God, what a mighty God, You are

BRIDGE
Glory, glory, and a thousand hallelujahs
Oh Lord my God, how great You are

Honor, power, and another hallelujah
Oh Lord my God, how great You are

Glory, glory, and a thousand hallelujahs
Oh Lord my God, how great You are

Honour, power, and another hallelujah
Oh Lord my God, how great You are

CHORUS
What a mighty God, what a mighty God, You are
What a mighty God, what a mighty God, You are
What a mighty God, what a mighty God, You are
What a mighty God, what a mighty God, You are
