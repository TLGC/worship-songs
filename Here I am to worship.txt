VERSE 1
Light of the world, You step down into darkness.
Opened my eyes let me see.
Beauty that made this heart adore You
Hope of a life spent with You.

CHORUS
And here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down,
Here I am to say that You're my God,
You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.

VERSE 2
King of all days,
Oh so highly exalted glorious in heaven above
Humbly You came to the earth You created
All for love's sake became poor

CHORUS
And here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down,
Here I am to say that You're my God,
You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me

BRIDGE (4x)
I'll never know how much it cost to see my sin upon that cross.

TAG
Call upon the name of the Lord and be saved

BRIDGE (4x)
I'll never know how much it cost to see my sin upon that cross.

CHORUS
Here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down,
Here I am to say that You're my God,
You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.

So Here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down,
Here I am to say that You're my God,
