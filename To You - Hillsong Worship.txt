VERSE 1
Here I stand
Forever in Your mighty hand
Living with Your promise
Written on my heart

VERSE 2
I am Yours
Surrendered wholly to You,
You set me in Your family
Calling me Your own

CHORUS 1
Now I, I belong to You
Lord I need,
Your Spirit Your word Your truth
Hear my cry
My deep desire
To know You more

CHORUS 2
In Your Name
I will lift my hands
To the King
This anthem of praise I bring
Heaven knows
I long to love You
With all I am
I belong to You
