VERSE 1
Lord Almighty hear my plea
When the devil comes to me
Let Your word my weapon be
That I may live in victory
That I may live in victory

CHORUS 1
This is the anthem of my soul
Christ in me, my only hope
No other name, no other throne
Christ in me, my only hope
Christ in me, my only hope

VERSE 2
Of my sins, You know them all
Still, You love me through the fall
Worn and blistered soul I am
It's only by Your grace I'll stand
Oh, it's only by Your grace I'll stand

CHORUS 1
This is the anthem of my soul
Christ in me, my only hope
No other name, no other throne
Christ in me, my only hope
Christ in me, my only hope

BRIDGE (3x)
Though the storms rage on
Though the darkness comes
Still our God will have His say
For the wind stands still and the demons fall
At the mention of His name

VERSE 3
When I arrive at Heaven's gates
And I see Jesus face to face
I'll fall and worship at His feet
The One who bore the cross for me
The One who bore the cross, for me

CHORUS 2
This is the anthem of my soul
Christ in me, my only hope
No other name, no other throne
Christ in me, my only hope
Christ in me, my only hope
Christ in me, my only hope

OUTRO
You are my only hope
