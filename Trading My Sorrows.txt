CHORUS
I'm trading my sorrows
I'm trading my shame
I'm laying them down for the joy of the lord

CHORUS (2)
I'm trading my sickness
I'm trading my pain
I'm laying it down for the joy of the lord

VERSE 3
We say yes lord yes lord yes yes lord
Yes lord yes lord yes yes lord
Yes lord yes lord yes yes lord amen

CHORUS
I'm pressed but not crushed persecuted but not abandoned
Struck down but not destroyed
I am blessed beyond the curse for His promise will endure
That His joy's gonna be my strength
Though the sorrow may last for the night
His joy comes with the morning
