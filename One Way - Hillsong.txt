VERSE 1
I lay my life down at Your feet
Cause You're the only one I need
I turn to You and You were always there
In troubled times it's You I seek
I put You first that's all I need
I humble all I am, All to You

Jesus
You're the only one that I could live for

Every how and everywhere

You will never ever change
Yesterday today the same
Forever till forever meets no end
