VERSE 1
You unravel me with a melody
You surround me with a song
Of deliverance from my enemies
'Til all my fears are gone

CHORUS (2x)
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God

VERSE 2
From my mother's womb
You have chosen me
Love has called my name
I've been born again
Into Your family
Your blood flows through my veins

CHORUS (3x)
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God

BRIDGE
I am surrounded
By the arms of the father
I am surrounded
By songs of deliverance

BRIDGE (P2)
We've been liberated
From our bondage
We're the sons and the daughters
Let us sing our freedom

BRIDGE (2x)
You split the sea
So I could walk right through it
My fears were drowned in perfect love
You rescued me
And I could stand and sing
I am a child of God

Yes, I am
I am a child of God
I am a child of God

Yes, I am
I am a child of God
Full of faith

Yes, I am
a child of God
I am a child of God

TAG (END)
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
