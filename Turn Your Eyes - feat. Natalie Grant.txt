VERSE 1
Oh soul are you weary and troubled
No light in the darkness you see
But just one look at the Saviour
Is life more abundant and free
So just look up: your help is on the way 

CHORUS
Turn, turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full, look full in His wonderful face
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
When you turn, turn your eyes upon Him

Turnaround

VERSE 2
His Word forever unfailing
His promise an anchor to hold
Here in the midst of your sorrow
His presence is healing your soul
So just look up: your help is on the way

CHORUS
Turn, turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full, look full in His wonderful face
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
When you turn, turn your eyes upon Him

Turnaround,
Turnaround
