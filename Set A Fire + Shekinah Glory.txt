CHORUS
Set a fire down in my soul that
I can't contain
And I can't control
I want more of You God
I want more of You God

VERSE 3
When You move, and we want more
When You speak, and we want more
When You move, and we want more
We want the fullness

CHORUS
Release the fullness of Your Spirit
Shekinah glory come
Shekinah glory come

BRIDGE
I can't get enough of Your presence, presence
I can't get enough of Your presence, presence
I can't get enough of Your presence, presence
I can't get enough, can't get enough

VERSE 3
When You move, and we want more
When You speak, and we want more
When You move, and we want more
We want the fullness

CHORUS (2x)
Release the fullness of Your Spirit
Shekinah glory come
Shekinah glory come

BRIDGE
We want more
We want more
We want more
We want more
We want more
We want more
More of Your Spirit

BRIDGE (END)
The Lord has given us freedom
Given us freedom
Given us joy
