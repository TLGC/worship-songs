Don’t want to stand here and shout Your praise
And walk away and forget Your Name
I’ll stand for You if it’s all I do
'Cause there is none that compare to You

And all I want in this lifetime is You,
And all I want in this whole world is You, You, You

Tell the world that Jesus lives
Tell the world that, tell the world that
Tell the world that He died for them
Tell the world that He lives again

No longer I but Christ in me
'Cause it’s the truth that set me free

But by Thy mercy and by Thy grace

'Cause all I want in this lifetime is You,
And all I want in this whole world is You, You, You
