VERSE 1
I take the bread of life
Broken for all my sin
Your body crucified
To make me whole again

VERSE 2
I will recall the cup
Poured out in sacrifice
To trade this sinners' end
For Your new covenant 

CHORUS
Hallelujah
I'll live my life in remembrance
Hallelujah Your promise I won't forget

VERSE 3
I'll walk salvation's road
With fear and trembling
Your way borne as my own
As Christ is formed in me

CHORUS
Hallelujah 
I'll live my life in remembrance
Hallelujah
Your promise I won't forget

POST CHORUS 1
If ever I should lose my way
If ever I deny Your grace
Remind me of the price You paid
Hallelujah
I'll live in remembrance

BRIDGE (2x)
You've been so so good to me
You've been so so good to me
Oh to think where I would be
If not for You
If not for You

POST CHORUS 2
As far as heights reach from the depths
As far as east is from the west
So far Your grace has carried me

POST CHORUS 3
Until I see You face to face
Until at last I've won my race
Remind me You ºre not finished yet

TAG
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
I'll live in remembrance
