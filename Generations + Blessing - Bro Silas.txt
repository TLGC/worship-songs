I’m a part of the promise
So I count the stars in the heavens
And number all my descendants,
As I’m crying out for redemption 
For a chosen generation 

Your blessing is in family
You take pleasure in Your people
I hear a cry from heaven saying
You will bear much fruit

I’m a part of the promise
So I count the stars in the heavens
And number all my descendants,
As I’m crying out for redemption 
For a chosen generation 
For a thousand generations
For a thousand generations

May His favor be upon you
And a thousand generations
And your family and your children
And their children, and their children

May His presence go before you
And behind you, and beside you
All around you, and within you
He is with you, He is with you
In the morning, in the evening
In your coming, and your going
In your weeping, and rejoicing
He is for you, He is for you
He is for you, He is for you
He is for you, He is for you
He is for you, He is for you 

Amen

May His favor be upon you
And a thousand generations
And your family and your children
And their children, and their children



The Lord bless you
And keep you
Make His face shine upon you
And be gracious to you
The Lord turn His
Face toward you
And give you peace

Makamtam mo ang biyaya
At ng bawat salinlahi
At ng bawat pamilya 
At anak ng ‘yong anak oh

Ang presensya’y maranasan
Sa lahat ng ‘yong daanan
Sa ‘yong puso, sa ‘yong buhay
Diyos ay lagi mong kasama

Sa pagtulog, sa paggising
Sa paglisan, sa paglapit
Sa ligaya, sa pagluha
Diyos ay lagi mong kasama
Siya’y kasama

Amen
