Father to the fatherless
Defender of the weak
Freedom for the prisoner

This is God in His holy place
This is God clothed in love and strength

Sing out, lift your voice and cry out
Awesome is our strong God, mighty is our God

There is none higher, no
There is none greater, no
There is none stronger than our God

There is none higher, no
There is none greater, no
There is none stronger than our God
