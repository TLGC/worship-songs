VERSE
Here I am waiting, abide in me, I pray
Here I am longing for You
Hide me in Your love, bring me to my knees
May I know Jesus more and more

CHORUS
Come live in me all my life, take over
Come breathe in me, I will rise on eagle's wings
Come live in me all my life, take over
Come breathe in me, I will rise on eagle's wings

VERSE
Here I am waiting, abide in me, I pray
Here I am longing for You
Hide me in Your love, bring me to my knees
May I know Jesus more and more

CHORUS
Come live in me all my life, take over
Come breathe in me, I will rise on eagle's wings
Come live in me all my life, take over
Come breathe in me, I will rise on eagle's wings

CHORUS
Come live in me all my life, take over
Come breathe in me, I will rise on eagle's wings

END
I will rise on eagle's wings, I will rise on eagle's wings
I will rise on eagle's wings, I will rise on eagle's wings
I will rise on eagle's wings, I will rise on eagle's wings
