You are God, and we lift You up
We keep singing, we keep praising
We won't stop giving all we got
'Cause You're worthy of all Your glory

Oh, there is no other
You are forever, Lord over all
Nobody like You, no one beside You

CHORUS
To You
Let endless praise resound
Every night and day, and with no delay
Let endless praise resound

Oh, there is no other
You are forever, Lord over all
Nobody like You, no one beside You

To You
Let endless praise resound
Every night and day, and with no delay
Let endless praise resound

We lift You up, up, up
We're giving You our love, love, love
For everything You've done, done, done
We give You all the praise

To You
Let endless praise resound
Every night and day, and with no delay
Let endless praise resound
