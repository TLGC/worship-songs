His blood has covered my sin
I believe

My shame He's taken away
My pain is healed in His name
I believe

I'll raise a banner
'Cause my Lord has conquered the grave

My Redeemer Lives
My Redeemer Lives
My Redeemer Lives

I'll raisen a banner
'Cause My Lord has conquered the grave

I'm dancing on this mountain top to see Your kingdom come
