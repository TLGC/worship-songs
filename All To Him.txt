VERSE 1
For every mountain that is high He is higher
For every burden that is great He is greater
For every valley that is deep He is deeper still
More than we can know

Our promise is Jesus
Our answer is Jesus
All to Him
All to Him we owe everything
Our Saviour is Jesus
Our future is Jesus
All to Him
All to Him we owe everything

VERSE 3
For every fear that closes in He is closer
For every doubt that comes on strong He is stronger
For every battle that we face He has conquered all
More than we can know

CHORUS
Our promise is Jesus
Our answer is Jesus
All to Him
All to Him we owe everything
Our Saviour is Jesus
Our future is Jesus
All to Him
All to Him we owe everything

BRIDGE (2x)
We know the great God
We serve the great God
We owe the great God
Everything all to Him

CHORUS
Our promise is Jesus
Our answer is Jesus
All to Him
All to Him we owe everything
Our Saviour is Jesus
Our future is Jesus
All to Him
All to Him we owe everything
