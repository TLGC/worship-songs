One day You’ll make everything new, Jesus
One day You will bind every wound
The former things shall all pass away
No more tears

One day You’ll make sense of it all, Jesus
One day every question resolved
Every anxious thought left behind
No more fear

We'll sing and shout the victory

Is there a greater vision of grace
And in a moment we shall be changed
On that day

One day all this struggle will cease
And we will see Your glory revealed
On that day
