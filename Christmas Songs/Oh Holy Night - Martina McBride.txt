VERSE 1
Oh holy night!
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth!

Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'til He appeared and the soul felt its worth

The thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

CHORUS
Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night, divine
Oh night, when Christ was born
Oh night, divine

Oh night, Oh night divine

VERSE 1

CHORUS (2x)
Oh night, Oh night divine
