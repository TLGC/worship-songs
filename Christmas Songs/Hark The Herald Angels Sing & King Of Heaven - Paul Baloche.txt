VERSE 1
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled

Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic hosts proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King

VERSE 2
Hail the heav'n born Prince of Peace
Hail the Son of righteousness
Light and life to all He brings
Risen with healing in His wings

Mild He lays His glory by
Born that man no more may die
Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King

CHORUS
King of Heaven come down
King of Heaven come now
Let Your glory reign
Shining like the day
King of Heaven come

King of Heaven rise up
Who can stand against us
You are strong to save
In Your mighty name
King of Heaven come

INTERLUDE 1
Ohh
Ohh

VERSE 3
Christ by highest heaven adored
Christ the ever-lasting Lord
Late in time behold Him come
Offspring of a virgin's womb

Mild He lays His glory by
Born that man no more may die
Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King

CHORUS
King of Heaven come down
King of Heaven come now
Let Your glory reign
Shining like the day
King of Heaven come

King of Heaven rise up
Who can stand against us
You are strong to save
In Your mighty name
King of Heaven come
