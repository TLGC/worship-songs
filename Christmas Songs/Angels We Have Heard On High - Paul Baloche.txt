VERSE 1
Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing ore the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains

CHORUS
Gloria in excelsis Deo

VERSE 2
Come to Bethlehem and see
Him Whose birth the angels sing
Come, adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord, the newborn King

CHORUS
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo

BRDIGE
We will raise our voices Deo
Join the angels song on high Deo
We behold Your beautiful light
Shining glory through the night Deo

Sweetly singing ore the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains

CHORUS
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo

BRDIGE
We will raise our voices Deo
Join the angels song on high Deo
We behold Your beautiful light
Shining glory through the night Deo
