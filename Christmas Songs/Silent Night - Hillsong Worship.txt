VERSE 1
Silent night holy night
All is calm all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

INSTRUMENTAL

VERSE
Silent night holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing hallelujah
Christ the Saviour is born,
Christ the Saviour is born

INSTRUMENTAL

VERSE 3
Silent night holy night
Son of God loveâ€™s pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at Thy birth 
Jesus Lord at Thy birth

VERSE 1
Silent night holy night
All is calm all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
