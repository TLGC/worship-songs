Verse 1
I raise a hallelujah, in the presence of my enemies
I raise a hallelujah, louder than the unbelief
I raise a hallelujah, my weapon is a melody
I raise a hallelujah, heaven comes to fight for me

Chorus
I’m gonna sing, in the middle of the storm
Louder and louder, You’re gonna hear my praises roar
Up from the ashes, hope will arise
Death is defeated, the King is alive

Verse 2
I raise a hallelujah, with everything inside of me
I raise a hallelujah, I will watch the darkness flee
I raise a hallelujah, in the middle of the mystery
I raise a hallelujah, fear You lost Your hold on me

Chorus
I’m gonna sing, in the middle of the storm
Louder and louder, You’re gonna hear my praises roar
Up from the ashes, hope will arise
Death is defeated, the King is alive
