VERSE 1
My heart a storm cloud’s
Raging deep within
The Prince of Peace came
Bursting through the wind
The violent sky held its breath
And in Your light I found rest

CHORUS
Tearing through the night
Riding on the storm
Starring down the fight
My eyes found Yours
Shining like the sun
Striding through my fear
The Prince of Peace met me there
You heard my prayer

VERSE 2
Hope like the sunlight
Piercing through the dark
The Prince of Peace
Came and broke into my heart
The violent cross, the empty grave
And in Your light I found grace

CHORUS
Tearing through the night
Riding on the storm
Starring down the fight
My eyes found Yours
Shining like the sun
Striding through my fear
The Prince of Peace met me there
You heard my prayer

BRIDGE 1
Your love surrounds me
When my thoughts wage war
When night screams terror
There Your voice will roar
Come death or shadow
God I know Your light will meet me there

When fear comes knocking
There You’ll be my guard
When day breeds trouble
There You’ll hold my heart
Come storm or battle
God I know Your peace will meet me there

BRIDGE 2
Oh, be still my heart
And know that You are God
Oh fear no evil
For I know You are here
And my soul will know Your…

BRIDGE 1
Your love surrounds me
When my thoughts wage war
When night screams terror
There Your voice will roar
Come death or shadow
God I know Your light will meet me there

When fear comes knocking
There You’ll be my guard
When day breeds trouble
There You’ll hold my heart
Come storm or battle
God I know Your peace will meet me there
