VERSE
This is the air I breathe
This is the air I breathe
Your holy presence living in me

This is my daily prayer
This is my daily prayer
Your very word spoken to me

CHORUS
And I, I'm desperate for You
And I, I'm I'm lost without You

VERSE
This is the air I breathe
This is the air I breathe
Your holy presence living in me

This is my daily prayer
This is my daily prayer
Your very word spoken to me

CHORUS
And I, I'm desperate for You
And I, I'm lost without You

CHORUS
And I, I'm desperate for You
And I, I'm lost without You
