VERSE 1
I wanna to be close close to Your side
So heaven is real and death is alive
I wanna hear voices of angels above
Singing as one

CHORUS
Hallelujah Holy Holy
God almighty Great I am
Who is worthy
None beside Thee
God Almighty
Great I Am

VERSE 2
I wanna be near near to Your heart
Loving the world
hating the dark
I want to see dry bones living again
Singing as one

CHORUS
Hallelujah
Holy Holy
God almighty Great I am
Who is worthy
None beside Thee
God Almighty
Great I Am

He's the Great, Great I Am

BRIDGE
The mountains shake before Him
The demons run and flee
At the mention of the name
King of Majesty
There is no power in hell
Or any who can stand
Before the power and the presence of the Great I am
The Great I am, The Great I am,
The Great I am, The Great I am, The Great I am

CHORUS
Hallelujah
Holy Holy
God almighty Great I am
Who is worthy
None beside Thee
God Almighty
Great I Am

Great I am

Post-CHORUS (5x)
The Great I am
