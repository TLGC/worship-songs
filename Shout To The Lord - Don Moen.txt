VERSE 1
My Jesus, my Saviour
Lord there is none like You
All of my days I want to praise
The wonders of Your mighty love

VERSE 2
My comfort, my shelter
Tower of refuge and strength
Let every breath, all that I am
Never cease to worship You

CHORUS
Shout to the Lord all the Earth, let us sing
Power and majesty, praise to the King
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar
At the sound of Your name

CHORUS (2)
I sing for joy at the work of Your hands
Forever I'll love You, forever I'll stand
Nothing compares to the promise I have
In You
