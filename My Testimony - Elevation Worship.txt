VERSE 1
I saw satan fall like lightning
I saw darkness run for cover
But the miracle that I just can’t get over
My name is registered in heaven

VERSE 2
I believe in signs and wonders
I have resurrection power
Still the miracle that I just can’t get over
My name is registered in heaven
My praise belongs to You forever

CHORUS
This is my testimony from death to life
Cause grace rewrote my story, I’ll testify
By Jesus Christ the Righteous, I’m justified
This is my testimony
This is my testimony

VERSE 3
Come together sons and daughters
Bought with blood and washed in water
Sing the praises of the Spirit, Son and Father
Our God will finish what He started
Our God will finish what He started

CHORUS
This is my testimony from death to life
Cause grace rewrote my story, I’ll testify
By Jesus Christ the Righteous, I’m justified
This is my testimony
This is my testimony

TAG (INSTRUMENTAL)

BRIDGE (4x)
If I’m not dead, You’re not done
Greater things are still to come
Oh I believe

CHORUS (2x)
This is my testimony from death to life
Cause grace rewrote my story, I’ll testify
By Jesus Christ the Righteous, I’m justified
This is my testimony
This is my testimony
