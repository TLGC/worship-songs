VERSE 1
The passion of our Saviour
The mercy of our God
The cross that leaves no question
Of the measure of His love

CHORUS
Our chains are gone, our debt is paid
The cross has overthrown the grave
For Jesus' blood that sets us free
Means death to death and life for me

VERSE 2
The Innocent judged guilty
While the guilty one walks free
Death would be His portion
And our portion liberty

CHORUS
Our chains are gone, our debt is paid
The cross has overthrown the grave
For Jesus' blood that sets us free
Means death to death and life for me

BRIDGE 1
I give my whole life to
Honour this love
By the Lamb who was slain,
I'm forgiven
The sinner's Saviour,
Crown Him forever
For the Lamb who was slain,
He is risen

BRIDGE 2
I give my whole life to
Honour this love
By the Lamb who was slain,
I'm forgiven
The sinner's Saviour,
Crown Him forever
For the Lamb who was slain,
He is risen

CHORUS
Our chains are gone, our debt is paid
The cross has overthrown the grave
For Jesus' blood that sets us free
Means death to death and life for me

TAG
Means death to death and life for me
