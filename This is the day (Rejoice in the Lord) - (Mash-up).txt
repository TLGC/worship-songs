VERSE
This is the day that the Lord has made
I will rejoice and be glad in it

CHORUS
Rejoice, in the Lord
Rejoice, in the Lord

Celebrate the presence of the Lord,
He is worthy to be praised

CHORUS
I will rejoice, I will rejoice
I will rejoice, for I made my choice
To rejoice in the Lord

CHORUS
Rejoice in the Lord, and shout for joy,
Rejoice in the Lord, sing hallelujah
