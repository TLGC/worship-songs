VERSE 1
There is singing at the ancient gates
There’s a melody of ceaseless praise
Age to age the sound is
Only growing stronger

VERSE 2
There’s a throne beneath the Name of names
There is seated on it One who reigns
And His kingdom now
Is here and getting closer

PRE-CHORUS 1
Praise Him like we’re there in glory
Here and now He’s just as holy
Jesus, He’s so worthy of it all

VERSE 3
He exists in everlasting light
So on heaven’s streets there is no night
Every tear is wiped away
We’ll know no sorrow

CHORUS
Worship Him with joyful sound
Sing until your voice gives out
No matter where or who’s around
Release your worship

PRE-CHORUS 2
Praise Him like we’re there in glory
Here and now He’s just as holy
Jesus, He’s so worthy of it all
Bring your song: He loves to hear it
Bring Him every prayer-soaked lyric
Jesus, He’s so worthy of it all

BRIDGE (4x)
The One who was, the One who is
The One who is to come

PRE-CHORUS 2
Praise Him like we’re there in glory
Here and now He’s just as holy
Jesus, He’s so worthy of it all
Bring your song: He loves to hear it
Bring Him every prayer-soaked lyric
Jesus, He’s so worthy of it all

BRDIGE (3x)
The One who was, the One who is
The One who is to come
