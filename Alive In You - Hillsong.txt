VERSE 1
Calling all believers
New life found within
The cross of Christ
For He is risen
Seated high and lifted above all
Above all

PRE-CHORUS
All Around the world
We sing Your praise
The anthem of creation
Our God reigns

CHORUS
Let the name of Jesus
Forever be glorified
We are alive in You
We are alive in You

VERSE 2
Redemption story
Our lives freely given life to see
Salvation drawing all hearts
Finding hope in Christ alone
In Christ alone

BRIDGE
You are risen
You are risen
You are risen
Christ our Saviour
You alone can satisfy
You alone created life
You alone are crowned as
Christ our Saviour

You alone set captives free
You alone have rescued me
You alone are Jesus
Christ our Saviour
