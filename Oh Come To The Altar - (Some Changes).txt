Are You hurting and broken within
Overwhelmed by the weight of Your sin

Have You come to the end of Yourself
Do You thirst for a drink from the well
Jesus is calling

Oh come to the altar
The Father’s arms are open wide
Forgiveness was bought with
The precious blood of Jesus Christ

Come today there’s no reason to wait

Bring Your sorrows and trade them for joy
From the ashes a new life is born
Jesus is calling

Oh come to the altar
The Father’s arms are open wide
Forgiveness was bought with
The precious blood of Jesus Christ

Oh come to the altar
The Father’s arms are open wide
