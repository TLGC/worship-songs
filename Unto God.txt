VERSE 1
You are the first, You are the last
No one is greater than You
No name is higher
You never fail, always prevail
We put our trust in You

You make a way where there seems to be no way

Unto God be all of the praise
Unto God be all of the praise
For He has done great things
So forever we will sing
To You
To You
