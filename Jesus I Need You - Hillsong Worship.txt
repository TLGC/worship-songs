VERSE 1
Hope be my anthem
Lord when the world has fallen quiet
You stand beside me
Give me a song in the night

CHORUS
Jesus I need You
Every moment, I need You
Hear now this grace bought heart sing out
Your praise forever

VERSE 2
Beauty for ashes
You find the weak and contrite heart
Shoulder its burdens
And carry it into the light

CHORUS (2x)
Jesus I need You
Every moment, I need You
Hear now this grace bought heart sing out
Your praise forever

BRIDGE (3x)
Remember love
Remember mercy
Christ before me
Christ behind me

Your loving kindness
Has never failed me
Christ before me
Christ behind me

CHORUS (2x)
Jesus I need You
Every moment, I need You
Hear now this grace bought heart sing out
Your praise forever

BRIDGE
Remember love
Remember mercy
Christ before me
Christ behind me

Your loving kindness
Has never failed me
Christ before me
Christ behind me
