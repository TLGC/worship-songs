INTRO (4x)
Come now rushing wind
Jesus breathe within

CHORUS (2x)
All my life
I will lift up Your praises
Till the end of the ages
I will sing of Your love
Your love won’t stop
Oh it runs like a river
You have so freely given
Every piece of Your heart

CHORUS (3x)
Oh, His Name is Jesus
Mighty Redeemer
My hope and my strength
Oh, I will never forget Him
From beginning to ending
He’s all that I want
