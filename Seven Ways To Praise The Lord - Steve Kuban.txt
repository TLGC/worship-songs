Sometimes when I'm feeling down
And the devil comes around
I start to make a joyful sound
That he cannot ignore
It's a heavenly idea
Guaranteed to make him flee-yah
Perfect panacea
Seven ways to praise the Lord

CHORUS
TODAH - sacrifice of praise
YADAH - let your hands be raised
BAROUCH - with a quiet voice
HALLEL - let your soul rejoice
ZAMAR - play for Him a song
TEHILLAH - you can sing along
SHABACH - shout for joy!
ThaT's seven ways to praise the Lord

YADAH - let your hands be raised

So practice each one faithfully
And very soon you're sure to see
That you have found a hundred
