VERSE 1
Creation knows the voice
That spoke into the void
The breath that brought the dust to life
And sang the stars to form

VERSE 2
The darkness fears Your voice
That drove it back before
And though the night is long
I know Your light will drive it back once more

CHORUS
One word from You
Things change on Your authority
Your word, it's true
Things change on Your authority

VERSE 3
My fight is not my own
Its end is in Your hands
I worship You because I know
All things must bow to Your command

CHORUS
One word from You
Things change on Your authority
Your word, it's true
Things change on Your authority

CHORUS
One word from You
Things change on Your authority
Your word, it's true
Things change on Your authority

BRIDGE 1
Will Heaven not prevail, and strongholds not be moved,
Will spirits not be silenced, and cower at His rule,
For if my God is for me, then what have I to fear,
And I will not deny Him, the glory that is His

BRIDGE 2
Will Heaven not prevail, and strongholds not be moved,
Will spirits not be silenced, and cower at His rule,
For if my God is for me, then what have I to fear,
And I will not deny Him, the glory that is His

BRIDGE 3
Heaven will prevail, and strongholds will be moved,
Spirits will be silenced, and cower at His rule,
I know my God is for me, so what have I to fear,
For nothing will deny Him, the glory that is His

CHORUS
One word from You
Things change on Your authority
Your word, it's true
Things change on Your authority

BRIDGE (OUTRO)
Heaven will prevail, and strongholds will be moved,
Spirits will be silenced, and cower at His rule,
I know my God is for me, so what have I to fear,
For nothing will deny Him, the glory that is His
