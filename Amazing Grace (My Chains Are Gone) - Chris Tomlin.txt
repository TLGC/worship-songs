And Grace my fears relieved

The hour I first believed

My chains are gone, I've been set free
My God, my Saviour has ransomed me
And like a flood His mercy rains
Unending love, Amazing Grace

As long as life endures

And like a flood His mercy rains
Unending love, Amazing Grace

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow
The sun forbear to shine
But God who called me here below
Will be forever mine
You are forever mine

And like a flood His mercy rains
Unending love, Amazing Grace
