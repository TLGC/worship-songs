Almighty God my Redeemer

No other name like Jesus
No power can stand against You

My feet are planted on this rock
And I will not be shaken
My hope it comes from You alone
My Lord and my salvation

CHORUS
Your praise is always on my lips
Your word is living in my heart
And I will praise You with a new song
My soul will bless You Lord

You fill my life with greater joy
Yes I delight myself in You
And I will praise You with a new song
My soul will bless You Lord

When I am weak You make me strong
When I'm poor I know I'm rich
For in the power of Your name
All things are possible
All things are possible
All things are possible
All things are possible
