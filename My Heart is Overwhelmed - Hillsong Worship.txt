VERSE 1
Perfect in love
Lord You came to earth You rescued me
You took my place
Upon that cross,
The stains that held me back
Were washed away
You made me whole

CHORUS
Your love has set the broken captives free
Your love released the chains once binding me
I’m found in grace
In love’s embrace
My heart is overwhelmed

VERSE 2
I stand redeemed
Your Spirit now alive within my heart
I walk with You all of my days
I shall live to glorify You God
Hear my soul rejoice

CHORUS
Your love has set the broken captives free
Your love released the chains once binding me
I’m found in grace
In love’s embrace
My heart is overwhelmed

BRIDGE (2x)
Sings my soul of how Your love has set me free
Sings my heart of how Your mercy rescued me
Hear my cry of endless love
To my Saviour and to my King
My heart is overwhelmed

CHORUS
Your love has set the broken captives free
Your love released the chains once binding me
I’m found in grace
In love’s embrace
My heart is overwhelmed
