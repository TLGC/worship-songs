VERSE 1
Hold me now
In the hands that created the heavens
Find me now
Where the grace runs as deep as Your scars

You pulled me from the clay
Set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again

VERSE 2
Lifted up
And my knees know it’s all for Your glory
That I might stand
With more reasons to sing than to fear

You pulled me from the clay
Set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again

CHORUS
So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now

Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

POST-CHORUS
Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
‘Cause Your grace holds me now

VERSE 3
And that grace
Owns the ground where the grave did
Where all my shame remains
Left for dead in Your wake
You crashed those age-old gates
You left no stone unturned
You stepped out of that grave
And shouldered me all the way

CHORUS
So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now

Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

CHORUS (POST)
Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
‘Cause Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
‘Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now

TAG
Your grace holds me now

CHORUS
So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now

Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

CHORUS (POST)
Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
‘Cause Your grace holds me now
