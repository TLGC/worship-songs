CHORUS
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever

VERSE 1
Over the mountains and the sea
Your river runs with love for me
And I will open up my heart
And let the Healer set me free

I'm happy to be in the truth
And I will daily lift my hands
For I will always sing
Of when Your love came down

CHORUS (2x)
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever

VERSE 1
Over the mountains and the sea
Your river runs with love for me
And I will open up my heart
And let the Healer set me free

I'm happy to be in the truth
And I will daily lift my hands
For I will always sing
Of when Your love came down

CHORUS
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever

BRIDGE
Oh I feel like dancing
It's foolishness I know
But when the world has seen the light
They will dance with joy like we're dancing now

CHORUS
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
