VERSE
There is one on the throne
Jesus holy
He is worthy of praise
Honor and glory

CHORUS
Worthy is the Lamb
Who was slain
And seated on the throne
There's no one like the Lord
Elders creatures bow
Giving praise to Him
And Him alone
There's no one like the Lord

And seated on the throne

Giving praise to Him
And Him alone
There's no one like the Lord

We crown you King of glory
