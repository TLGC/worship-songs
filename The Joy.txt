VERSE 1
This is the day You made
So I’ll rejoice and be glad, rejoice and be glad in it
This is where I believe
You are more than enough, more than enough for me

PRE-CHORUS
You are faithful to Your promise, You are strong when I am weak
When I’m standing in Your presence, I have everything I need

CHORUS
The joy of the Lord, the joy of the Lord is my strength
The joy of the Lord, the joy of the Lord is my strength
O my soul, bless His Name
All that is within me say
The joy of the Lord, the joy of the Lord is my strength

VERSE 2
Jesus, come what may
You are worthy of all, worthy of all my praise

BRIDGE 
Let it rise up like a river, overflowing, Holy Spirit
Let it pour out with no limit, overflowing, Holy Spirit
