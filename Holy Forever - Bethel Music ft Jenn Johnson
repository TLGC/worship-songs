A thousand generations falling down in worship
To sing the song of ages to the Lamb
And all who've gone before us
And all who will believe
Will sing the song of ages to the Lamb

All creation cries Holy
You are lifted high Holy
Holy forever

Sing the song forever to the Lamb

Sing the song forever to the Lamb
We will sing the song forever and amen
