VERSE 1
There is a king seated among us
Let every heart receive Him now
Where there is praise He will inhabit
There will be grace and mercy all around

CHORUS 1
Every burden will be lifted in His presence
And Every trophy
Will be laid down at His feet
There is a name that reigns above all others
Jesus Christ the King above all kings

VERSE 2
Unto the Lamb honour and glory
Worthy is He who overcame
Buried in shame risen in power
He is alive and the stone is rolled away

CHORUS 2
All our worship will belong to Him forever
Death is conquered
And our Saviour holds the keys
There is a name that reigns above all others
Jesus Christ the King above all kings

VERSE 3
It won’t be long we will behold Him
And every tear He’ll wipe away
We'll be at home the war will be over
Soon we will meet our Saviour face to face

CHORUS 1
Every burden will be lifted in His presence
And Every trophy
Will be laid down at His feet
There is a name that reigns above all others
Jesus Christ the king above all kings

CHORUS 3
All our worship will belong to You forever
Holy holy for all eternity
Yours is the name that reigns above all others
Jesus Christ the King above all kings
Jesus Christ the King above all kings
