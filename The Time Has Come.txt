VERSE 1
Found love beyond all reason
You gave Your life Your all for me
And called me Yours forever
Caught in the mercy fallout
I found hope found life
Found all I need
Cause You're all I need

PRE-CHORUS
The time has come
To stand for all we believe in
So I for one
I'm gonna give my praise to You

CHORUS
Today today
It's all or nothing
All the way
Praise goes out to You
Yeah all the praise goes out to You

Today today
I live for one thing
To give You praise
In everything I do
Yeah all the praise goes out to You

BACK TO VERSE 1 (1x)

BRIDGE
All we are is Yours
And all we're living for
Is all You are
Is all that You are

BACK-PRE-CHORUS (2x)
