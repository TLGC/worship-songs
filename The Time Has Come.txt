Found love beyond all reason
You gave Your life Your all for me
And called me Yours forever

Caught in the mercy fallout
I found hope found life
Found all I need
Cause You're all I need

The time has come
To stand for all we believe in
So I for one
I'm gonna give my praise to You

It's all or nothing
All the way
Praise goes out to You
Yeah all the praise goes out to You

Today today
I live for one thing
To give You praise
In everything I do
Yeah all the praise goes out to You
