Till it's all that I know
Set me ablaze, set me ablaze
So I'll never grow cold

Breathe, come and breathe
On the coals of my heart,

Breathe, come and breathe
On the coals of my heart
Keep me burning
Breathe, come and breathe
On the coals of my heart,
May Your fire start
Come and breathe
On the coals of my heart oh

Set me ablaze, set me ablaze
With a single obsession
Set me ablaze, set me ablaze
With an endless passion

CHORUS (2x)
Breathe, come and breathe
On the coals of my heart,

Breathe, come and breathe
On the coals of my heart
Keep me burning
Breathe, come and breathe
On the coals of my heart,
May Your fire start
Come and breathe
On the coals of my heart oh
