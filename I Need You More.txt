CHORUS
I need You more,
more than yesterday
I need You more
More than words can say
I need You more
Than ever before
I need You Lord,
I need You Lord

VERSE
More than the air I breathe
More than the song I sing
More than the next heartbeat
More than anything, and Lord as time goes by
I'll be by Your side
Cause I never want to go back to my old life

CHORUS
I need You more,
more than yesterday
I need You more
More than words can say
I need You more
Than ever before
I need You Lord,
I need You Lord

VERSE
More than the air I breathe
More than the song I sing
More than the next heartbeat
More than anything, and Lord as time goes by
I'll be by Your side
Cause I never want to go back to my old life

CHORUS (2x)
I need You more,
more than yesterday
I need You more
More than words can say
I need You more
Than ever before
I need You Lord,
I need You Lord

BRIDGE(3x)
We give You the highest praise

BRIDGE (Ending)
More than the air I breathe
More than the song I sing
More than anything
I need You more
