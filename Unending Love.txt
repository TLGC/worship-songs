VERSE 1
There's no silver or gold
And no treasure untold
That could draw me away from Your heart
Neither love of myself
Or of anyone else will do

PRE-CHORUS
Jesus nothing compares
To this grace that rescues me
Saviour now and forever
Your face is all I seek

CHORUS
Now all I am
I lay at Your feet
I'm humbled by the wonder of Your majesty
One thing I know
I find all I need
In Your unending love
In Your unending love

VERSE 2
Letting go of my pride
I lay down my desires
Just to worship in Spirit and truth
More than all of my dreams
More than fame I will seek You Lord

PRE-CHORUS
Jesus nothing compares
To this grace that rescued me
Saviour now and forever
Your face is all I seek

CHORUS
Now all I am
I lay at Your feet
I'm humbled by the wonder of Your majesty
One thing I know
I find all I need
In Your unending love
In Your unending love

CHORUS
Now all I am
I lay at Your feet
I'm humbled by the wonder of Your majesty
One thing I know
I find all I need
In Your unending love
In Your unending love
