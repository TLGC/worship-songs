VERSE 1
In the crushing 
In the pressing
You are making new wine
In the soil I now surrender
You are breaking new ground

PRE-CHORUS
So I yield to You and to Your careful hand
When I trust You I donâ€™t need to understand

CHORUS
So make me Your vessel
Make me an offering
Make me whatever You want me to be

I came here with nothing
But all You have given me
Jesus bring new wine out of me

VERSE 2

In the pressing
You are making new wine
In the soil I now surrender
You are breaking new ground

So make me Your vessel
Make me an offering

'Cause where there is new wine
There is new power
There is new freedom and 
The Kingdom is here
I lay down my old flames
To carry Your new fire today
