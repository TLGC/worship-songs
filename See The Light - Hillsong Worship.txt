VERSE 1
Arise my soul
Remember this
He took my sin
And He buried it

CHORUS
No longer I who live
Now Jesus lives in me
For I was dead in sin
But I woke up to see the light

VERSE 2
No I wonâ€™t boast
But in the cross
That saved my soul
All else is loss

VERSE 3
The grip of fear
Has no hold on me
So where oh death
Where is your sting

CHORUS
No longer I who live
Now Jesus lives in me
For I was dead in sin
But I woke up to see the light

BRIDGE (x6)
All, all of this for Your glory

CHORUS
No longer I who live
Now Jesus lives in me
For I was dead in sin
But I woke up to see the light

BRIDGE (x4)
All, all of this for Your glory
