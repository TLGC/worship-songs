VERSE 1
This is no performance
Lord I pray it’s worship
Empty words I can’t afford
I’m not chasing feelings
That’s not why I’m singing
You’re the reason for my song

CHORUS
'Cause I only wanna sing
If I sing with everything
If I sing for you my King
I can’t imagine why
I would do this all for hype
Cause it’s all to lift You high

VERSE 2
You don’t want perfection
Just my soul’s attention
All I have is what I’ll give

VERSE 3
More than a song that lasts a moment
I’ll live a life full of honest worship
If I’m here to sing then I’ll sing with purpose
All the praise Lord, You deserve it

CHORUS (2x)
'Cause I only wanna sing
If I sing with everything
If I sing for you my King
I can’t imagine why
I would do this all for hype
Cause it’s all to lift You high


CHORUS (End)
'Cause I only wanna sing
If I sing with everything
If I sing for you my King
