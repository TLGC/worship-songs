VERSE
My Saviour,
Redeemer,
Lifted me from the miry clay.
Almighty,
Forever, I will never be the same,

PRE-CHORUS
Cause You came near,
From the everlasting,
To the world we live,
The Father's only Son.

CHORUS
You lived.
You died.
You rose again on high.
You opened the way for the world to live again.
Hallelujah, for all You've done.

END
Hallelujah, for all You've done.
