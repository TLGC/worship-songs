VERSE
My savior,
Redeemer,
Lifted me from the miry clay.
Almighty,
Forever, I will never be the same,

Refrain
Cause You came here,
From the everlasting,
To the world we live,
The Father's only Son.

CHORUS
And You lived.
You died.
You rose again on high.
You opened the way for the world to live again.
Hallelujah, for all You've done.
