VERSE 1
The First Noel the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay
In fields where they Lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night 
That was so deep

CHORUS
Noel Noel Noel Noel

VERSE 2
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night

CHORUS
Noel Noel Noel Noel

CHORUS

Born is the King of Israel

CHORUS

Born is the King of Israel

CHORUS

Born is the King of Israel
