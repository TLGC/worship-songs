VERSE
How beautiful this love
You would lay down Your crown
Surrender Your throne in heaven
So that I could be found

How awesome is this love
That conquered the grave
Love that can move the mountains
Yet knows me by name

PRE-CHORUS
It's unbreakable
It's undeniable
Nothing will ever
Separate us

CHORUS
Your love is higher
Than the skies up above
Your love is wider
Than what I can dream of
Your love is deeper
It's the greatest of all
The greatest of all
