I know You had me on Your mind
When You climbed up on that hill
For You saw me with eternal eyes
While I was yet in sin

Every stripe upon Your battered back
Every thorn that pierced Your brow
Every nail drove deep through guiltless hands
Said that Your love knows no end

You're familiar with my weaknesses
Devoted to the end

So the grace You poured out on my life
Will return to You in praise
I'll gladly lay down all my crowns
For the name of which I'm saved

You're familiar with my weaknesses
Devoted to the end
