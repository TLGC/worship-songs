VERSE 1
Have you been praying and you still have no answers?
Have you been pouring out your heart for so many years?
Have you been hoping that things would have changed by now?
Have you cried all the faith you have through so many tears?

PRE-CHORUS
Don't forget the things that He has done before
And remember He can do it all once more

CHORUS
It's like the brightest sunrise
Waiting on the other side of the darkest night
Don't ever lose hope, hold on and believe
Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it yet
You're closer than you think you are
Only moments from the break of dawn
All His promises are just up ahead
Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it yet (Oh)
Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it yet (Oh)
Maybe you just haven't seen it

VERSE 2
He had the solution before you had the problem
He sees the best in you when you feel at your worst
So in the questioning, don't ever doubt His love for you
'Cause it's only in His love that you'll find a breakthrough, oh

CHORUS
It's like the brightest sunrise
Waiting on the other side of the darkest night
Don't ever lose hope, hold on and believe
Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it yet
You're closer than you think you are
Only moments from the break of dawn
All His promises are just up ahead
Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it yet (Oh)
Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it yet (Oh)
Maybe you just haven't seen it

BRIDGE
He is moving with a love so deep
Hallelujah for the victory
Good things are coming even when we can't see
We can't see it yet, but we believe that
He is moving with a love so deep
Hallelujah for the victory
Good things are coming even when we can't see
We can't see it yet, but we believe that

CHORUS
It's like the brightest sunrise
Waiting on the other side of the darkest night
Don't ever lose hope, hold on and believe (Don't ever lose hope)
Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it yet
You're closer than you think you are (Think you are)
Only moments from the break of dawn (Oh)
All His promises are just up ahead
Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it yet (Oh)
Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it yet (Oh)
(You gotta hold on, hold on)
Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it yet (Oh)

TAG (Outro)
(Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it yet)
Just haven't seen it yet, ooh
