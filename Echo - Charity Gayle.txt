VERSE 1
You moved the mountains
Told the wind and waves be still
You cast out demons
And bid the empty soul be filled

Now there's freedom in Your name
You gave us power
And the keys to do the same

You hold redemption
Made accusers drop their stones
You showed us mercy
With Your mighty miracles

PRE CHORUS
And now there's breakthrough
Now there's freedom in Your name

And the keys to do the same

In Jesus' name
Walls fall down
In Jesus' name
Strongholds break
In Jesus' name
Amen

We are healed
In Jesus' name
There are miracles
In Jesus' name
Pour them out
In Jesus' name
Amen

And made a fool of death and grave
Oh King Jesus
You make royals out of slaves

Now there's freedom in Your name

Strongholds break
In the name of Jesus
