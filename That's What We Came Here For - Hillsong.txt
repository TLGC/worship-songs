You deserve the highest praise

VERSE 1
We come into Your presence with singing
We come into Your presence with praise
Enter Your gates with thankful hearts
We are gonna celebrate

All of Heaven's waiting
Power's on its way
So we shout Hallelujah
Lift it to You
A mighty roar of praise

You deserve the highest praise
We can give and more
Lord, we give our praise
That's what we came here for

BRIDGE (2x)
Everything within me reaches out to You
Your power and majesty, grace and mercy too
There'll be singing and dancing
Hearts and voices raised
You have set Your people free
Now the house is filled with praise

CHORUS (2x)
You deserve the highest praise
We can give and more
Lord, we give our praise
That's what we came here for

END
Lord, we give our praise
That's what we came here for
