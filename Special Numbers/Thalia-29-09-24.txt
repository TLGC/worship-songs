Who tells the Sun to rise every morning?
Colors the sky with the shades of His glory?
Wakes us with mercy and love? 
Jesus does

Who holds the orphan, comforts the widow?
Cries for injustice, feels every sorrow?
Carries the pain of His children? 
Jesus does

So we sing praise to the Father who gave us the Son
Praise to the Spirit who's livin' in us
When I was a sinner, He saved me from who I was
'Cause that's what Jesus does

Who understands the heart of a sinner?
Showers His grace over all our mistakes?
Washes us clean with His blood? 
Jesus does,

Who sings a song of sweet forgiveness?
Who stole the keys to hell and the grave?
Who has the power to save? Jesus does

So we sing praise to the Father who gave us the Son
Praise to the Spirit who's livin' in us
When I was a sinner, He saved me from who I was
'Cause that's what Jesus does

Oh, what a friend, oh, what a Savior
He's always been good, He's always been faithful
He came to my rescue when I needed Him most
He saved my soul

So we sing praise to the Father who gave us the Son
Praise to the Spirit who's livin' in us
When I was a sinner, He saved me from who I was

So we sing praise to the Father who gave us the Son
Praise to the Spirit who's livin' in us
When I was a sinner, He saved me from who I was
God, I know that's what Jesus does
