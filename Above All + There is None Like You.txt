CHORUS
You were Crucified
And Laid behind the stone
You lived to die
Rejected and alone,
Like a rose trampled on the ground
You took the fall
And thought of me
Above all

VERSE 1
Above all powers
Above all kings
Above all nature and all created things
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man
You were here before the world began

VERSE 2
Above all kingdoms
Above all thrones
Above all wonders the world has ever known
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth
There's no way to measure what You're worth

CHORUS
You were Crucified
And Laid behind the stone
You lived to die
Rejected and alone,
Like a rose trampled on the ground
You took the fall
And thought of me
Above all

Like a rose trampled on the ground
You took the fall
And thought of me
Above all

CHORUS
There is none like You
No one else can touch my heart like You do
And I could search for all eternity long
And find there is none like You,
There is none like You
No one else can touch my heart like You do
I could search for all eternity long
And find there is none like You

BRIDGE
Your mercy flows like a river so wide
Healing comes from Your hands
Suffering children are safe in Your arms
There is none like You

CHORUS
There is none like You
No one else can touch my heart like You do
I could search for all eternity long
And find there is none like You

I could search for all eternity long
And find there is none, there is none,
there is none like You
