VERSE 1
Heaven thundered
And the world was born
Life begins and ends
In the dust You formed

VERSE 2
Faith commanded
And the mountains moved
Fear is losing ground
To our hope in You

CHORUS
Unstoppable God
Let Your glory go, on and on
Impossible things
In Your name they shall be done

VERSE 3
Freedom conquered
All our chains undone
Sin defeated
Jesus has overcome

VERSE 4
Mercy triumphed
When the third day dawned
Darkness was denied
When the stone was gone

CHORUS
Unstoppable God
Let Your glory go, on and on
Impossible things
In Your name they shall be done

CHORUS
Unstoppable God
Let Your glory go, on and on
Impossible things
In Your name they shall be done

BRIDGE (4x)
Nothing shall be impossible
Your kingdom reigns unstoppable
Weâ€™ll shout Your praise forevermore
Jesus our God unstoppable

CHORUS (2x)
Unstoppable God
Let Your glory go, on and on
Impossible things
In Your name they shall be done
