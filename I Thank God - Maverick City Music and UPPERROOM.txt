VERSE 1
Wandering into the night
Wanting a place to hide
This weary soul
This bag of bones
And I try with all my might
But I just can't win the fight
I'm slowly drifting
Oh, vagabond

PRE-CHORUS
And just when I ran out of road
I met a man I didn't know
And He told me that I was not alone

CHORUS
He picked me up, He turned me around
He placed my feet on solid ground
I thank the Master, I thank the Saviour
Because He healed my heart, He changed my name
Forever free, I'm not the same
I thank the Master, I thank the Saviour
I thank God

PRE-CHORUS 2
I cannot deny what I see
Got no choice but to beliеve
My doubts are burning
Like ashеs in the wind
So, so long to my old friends
Burden and bitterness
You can just keep it moving
(Hey), hey nah, you ain't welcome here

PRE-CHORUS
From now 'til I walk the streets of gold
I'll sing of how You saved my soul
This wayward son has found his way back home

CHORUS
He picked me up, He turned me around
Placed my feet on solid ground
I thank the Master, I thank the Saviour
Because He healed my heart, He changed my name
Forever free, I'm not the same
I thank the Master, I thank the Saviour
Oh, I thank God

POST-CHORUS
Oh, I thank God
Oh, I thank God
Oh, I thank God

BRIDGE (9x)
Hell lost another one
I am free, I am free,
I am free

CHORUS
He picked me up, He turned me around
He placed my feet on solid ground
I thank the Master, I thank the Saviour
Because He healed my heart, He changed my name
Forever free, I am not the same
I thank the Master, I thank the Saviour
I thank God
