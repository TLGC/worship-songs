VERSE 1
These are the days of Elijah,
Declaring the word of the Lord
And these are the days of Your servant Moses,
Righteousness being restored

And though these are days of great trials
Of famine and darkness and sword,
Still, we are the voice in the desert crying
Prepare ye the way of the Lord

CHORUS
Behold He comes riding on the clouds,
Shining like the sun at the trumpet call
Lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee
And out of Zion's hill salvation comes

VERSE 2
And These are the days of Ezekiel,
The dry bones becoming as flesh
And these are the days of Your servant David
Rebuilding a temple of praise

And These are the days of the harvest,
The fields are as white in Your world,
And we are the labourers in Your vineyard,
Declaring the word of the Lord

CHORUS
Behold He comes riding on the clouds,
Shining like the sun at the trumpet call
Lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee
And out of Zion's hill salvation comes

BRIDGE
There's no God like Jehovah

CHORUS
Behold He comes riding on the clouds,
Shining like the sun at the trumpet call
Lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee
And out of Zion's hill salvation comes

TAG
Out of Zion's hill salvation comes
