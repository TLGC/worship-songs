VERSE 1
Let now the weak
say I have strength
By the Spirit of power
That raised Christ from the dead
Let now the poor
stand and confess
That my portion is Him
And I'm more than blessed

PRE-CHORUS
Let now our hearts burn with a flame
A fire consuming all for Your Son's Holy Name
And with the heavens we declare
You are our King

CHORUS 1
We love You Lord
We worship You
You are our God
You alone are good

VERSE 2
Let now Your church
shine as the bride
That You saw in Your heart
As You offered up Your life
Let now the lost
be welcomed home
By the saved and redeemed
Those adopted as Your own

PRE-CHORUS
Let now our hearts burn with a flame
A fire consuming all for Your Son's Holy Name
And with the heavens we declare
You are our King

CHORUS 1
We love You Lord
We worship You
You are our God
You alone are good

CHORUS 2
You asked Your Son
to carry this
The heavy cross
Our weight of sin

CHORUS 3
I love You Lord
I worship You
Hope which was lost
now stands renewed

CHORUS 4
I give my life
to honour this
The love of Christ
The Saviour King
