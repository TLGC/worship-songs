Chorus
We're giving it all away, away
We're giving it all to go Your way
We're giving it all away, away
We're giving it all to go Your way

VERSE 1
In the Father,
There is freedom
There is hope,
In the name that is Jesus

Lay Your life down,
Give it all now
We are found,
In the love of the Saviour

PRE-CHORUS
We've come alive in You
Set free to show the truth
Our lives will never be the same

CHORUS
We're giving it all away, away
We're giving it all to go Your way
We're giving it all away, away
We're giving it all to go Your way

VERSE 2
We are sold out,
For Your calling
Everything that we are,
For Your glory

Take our hearts now,
Have it all now
Let our lives shine Your light,
Like the morning

PRE-CHORUS
We've come alive in You
Set free to show the truth
Our lives will never be the same

CHORUS
We're giving it all away, away
We're giving it all to go Your way
We're giving it all away, away
We're giving it all to go Your way

BRIDGE
Roll back the curtains from our eyes
And now we can see You
Show us the way, Your truth and life
We offer our lives to bring You fame
We're caught in Your freedom
We're caught in Your freedom

CHORUS
We're giving it all away, away
We're giving it all to go Your way
We're giving it all away, away
We're giving it all to go Your way
