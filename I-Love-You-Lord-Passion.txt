VERSE 1
I love You, Lord
And I lift my voice
To worship You
Oh, my soul, rejoice
Take joy my King
In what You hear
And let it be a sweet, sweet sound
Let it be a sweet, sweet sound
Let it be a sweet, sweet sound
In Your ear

VERSE 2
All I have is Yours
Take my life Jesus
Let my heart sing
How I love You, Lord
How I need You, Jesus
Who I am, who I have, Jesus
I love You (You are everything)
I love You (In my life, take who I am)
I love You (How I love You Lord)
I love You (How I need You, Jesus)
I love You (Hear my heart sing)
I love You (Oh my God)
I love You (I love You, Jesus)
I love You (I love You, Lord)
I love You (I love You, Lord)
Ohh (So I sing, so I sing)
I love You
I love You
I love You

VERSE 3
You're brighter than the sun
Risen from the shadows
Seated on the throne of majesty
Higher than the skies and all we see
