VERSE 1
You are here as we lift You up
You are riding on our praise
Be enthroned over everything
You are seated in our praise
 
PRE-CHORUS
This is prophetic I can feel it in the air
We lift our praise and You change the atmosphere
With hearts open now everybody singing out... oh

CHORUS
Turn it up this sound of praise
Make it louder than any other
Lift Him up and shout His name
Over all

VERSE 2
As we praise, when I can feel the change
As Your presence now invades
Hear the sound of the broken chains
Prison doors are giving way

PRE-CHORUS
This is prophetic I can feel it in the air
We lift our praise and You change the atmosphere
With hearts open now everybody singing out... I am free

CHORUS (2x)
Turn it up this sound of praise
Make it louder than any other
Lift Him up and shout His name
Over all

BRIDGE (4x)
Our praise goes up
Your rain comes down

BRIDGE
With shouts of praise
We celebrate
King of glory enter in
You are riding on our praise
Oh Lord

CHORUS
Turn it up this sound of praise
Make it louder than any other
Lift Him up and shout His name
Over all
