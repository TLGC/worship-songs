VERSE 1
For we know the truth
Your truth has set us free
In Your Name alone
We have been released
You are here with us
You are here with us

VERSE 2
We are slaves no more
Freedom is our hope
Never looking back
Jesus You are Lord
We give all to You
We give all to You

CHORUS
Where the Spirit of the Lord
There is freedom,
Where the Spirit of the Lord
Chains are broken
Eyes are open
Christ is with us,
Christ is with us

VERSE 3
Who the Son has freed
He is free indeed
All our sin is gone
We have been redeemed
Jesus paid it all
Jesus paid it all

CHORUS (2x)
Where the Spirit of the Lord
There is freedom,
Where the Spirit of the Lord
Chains are broken
Eyes are open
Christ is with us,
Christ is with us

BRIDGE (3x)

BRIDGE 1
Open wide the gates of heaven
Fill our hearts as we surrender
Lord let Your presence fall
Lord let Your presence fall

BRIDGE 2
Open wide the gates of heaven
We will worship You forever
Lord let Your presence fall
Lord let Your presence fall

CHORUS
Where the Spirit of the Lord
There is freedom,
Where the Spirit of the Lord
Chains are broken
Eyes are open
Christ is with us,
Christ is with us
