VERSE 1
Lord I come to You
Let my heart be changed, renewed
Flowing from the grace
That I found in You

VERSE 2
Lord I've come to know
The weaknesses I see in me
Will be stripped away
By the power of Your love

CHORUS
Hold me close
Let Your love surround me
Bring me near
Draw me to Your side

And as I wait
I'll rise up like the eagle
And I will soar with You
Your Spirit leads me on
In the power of Your love

VERSE 3
Lord unveil my eyes
Let me see You face to face
The knowledge of Your love
As You live in me

VERSE 4
Lord renew my mind
As Your will unfolds in my life
In living every day
by the power of Your love

CHORUS
Hold me close
Let Your love surround me
Bring me near
Draw me to Your side

And as I wait
I'll rise up like the eagle
And I will soar with You
Your Spirit leads me on
In the power of Your love

CHORUS
Hold me close
Let Your love surround me
Bring me near
Draw me to Your side

And as I wait
I'll rise up like the eagle
And I will soar with You
Your Spirit leads me on
In the power of Your love

OUTRO
And I will soar with You
Your Spirit leads me on
In the power of Your love
