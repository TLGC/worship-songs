VERSE 1
I just want to speak the name of Jesus
Over every heart and every mind
Cause I know there is peace within Your presence
I speak Jesus

I just want to speak the name of Jesus
Till every dark addiction starts to break
Declaring there is hope and there is freedom
I speak Jesus

CHORUS
Your name is power
Your name is healing
Your name is life
Break every stronghold
Shine through the shadows
Burn like a fire

To every soul held captive by depression

Your name is healing

Shine through the shadows
Burn like a fire

Your name is power
Your name is healing
Your name is life
Break every stronghold
Shine through the shadows
Burn like a fire

Shout Jesus from the mountains
And Jesus in the streets
Jesus in the darkness over every enemy
Jesus for my family
I speak the holy name
Jesus
