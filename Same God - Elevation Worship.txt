VERSE 1
I'm calling on the God of Jacob
Whose love endures through generations
I know that You will keep Your covenant
I'm calling on the God of Moses
The One who opened up the ocean
I need You now to do the same thing for me
For me, for me

CHORUS
Oh God, my God, I need You
Oh God, my God, I need You now
How I need You now,
Oh Rock, Oh Rock of Ages
I'm standing on Your faithfulness
On Your faithfulness

VERSE 2
I'm calling on the God of Mary
Whose favor rests upon the lowly
I know with You all things are possible
I'm calling on the God of David
Who made a shepherd boy courageous
I may not face Goliath but I've got my own giants

CHORUS
Oh God, my God, I need You
Oh God, my God, I need You now
How I need You now,
Oh Rock, Oh Rock of Ages
I'm standing on Your faithfulness
On Your faithfulness

CHORUS
Oh God, my God, I need You
Oh God, my God, I need You now
How I need You now,
Oh Rock, Oh Rock of Ages
I'm standing on Your faithfulness
On Your faithfulness
