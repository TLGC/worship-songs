Verse 1
All it takes is one moment
And just one touch from You 
I put aside all distractions
I came for You, I came for You

Verse 2
I need You more than ever 
Nothing else satisfies
All my life I surrender
I’ll live for You, I’ll live for You
I came for You, I came for You

Pre-Chorus
I will trust You, I will trust You

Chorus
Holy Spirit You are welcome 
Come and move upon this place 
We desire an encounter once again

Tag
Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit

Verse 3
Now that my heart is open 
I am ready for You
Jesus take me deeper
I came for You, I came for You 
I came for You, I came for You

Chorus 2
Send your fire, Release Your power
So we’ll never be the same
We desire and encounter once again 

Bridge
We make way, We make room 
Lord let your spirit move
Have your way in this place 
Lord we have come for you
