Standing here in Your presence
Thinking of the good things You have done
Waiting here patiently
Just to hear Your still small voice again

Faithful till the end
Saviour, Healer,
Redeemer and Friend

CHORUS
I will worship You for who You are,
I will worship You for who You are,
I will worship You for who You are
Jesus
