VERSE 1
I'm coming back to the start
Where you found me
I'm coming back to your heart
Now I surrender
Take me
This is all I can bring

VERSE 2 (2x)
I'm coming back to the start
I got this freedom
In here we feel your heart
Your heartbeat for us
Take me
This is all I can bring

CHORUS
You'll never stop loving us
No matter how far we run
You'll never give up on us
All of heaven shouts let the future begin
Let the future begin

Take me
This is all I can bring

CHORUS
You'll never stop loving us
No matter how far we run
You'll never give up on us
All of heaven shouts let the future begin
Let the future begin

BRIDGE (5x)
I feel alive, I come alive
I am alive on God's great dance floor

God's great dance floor
