VERSE 1
I wanna sing a new song
shout it out louder than before
Let the whole earth sing
The whole earth sing
Yeah, oh oh oh

We can seek His face
Changed in His presence
Touched by His grace
There is a sound
I hear it all around
Worship is rising
And people crying out

CHORUS
I wanna sing a new song
shout it out louder than before
Let the whole earth sing
The whole earth sing
It's a song of praise
A song for all of the redeem
Let the whole earth sing
The whole earth sing

Never the same
He's taken my chains
There's freedom in Jesus
Power to save
There is a name
Like no other name
There's freedom in Jesus
Shout out His name

CHORUS
I wanna sing a new song
shout it out louder than before
Let the whole earth sing
The whole earth sing
It's a song of praise
A song for all of the redeem
Let the whole earth sing
The whole earth sing

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I wanna sing a new song
shout it out louder than before
Let the whole earth sing
The whole earth sing
It's a song of praise
A song for all of the redeem
Let the whole earth sing
The whole earth sing
