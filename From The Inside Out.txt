VERSE
A thousand times I've failed
Still Your mercy remains
And should I stumble again
I'm caught in Your grace

VERSE
Everlasting
Your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your glory goes beyond all fame

VERSE
Your will above all else
My purpose remains
The art of losing myself
In bringing You praise

VERSE
Everlasting
Your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your glory goes beyond all fame

CHORUS
In my heart and my soul
Lord I give You control
Consume me from the inside out,
Lord, let justice and praise
Become my embrace
To love you from the inside out

Your will above all else
My purpose remains
The art of losing myself
In bringing You praise

Your light will shine when all else fades

I give You control
Consume me from the inside out,

Become my embrace
To love You from the inside out

Everlasting
Your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your glory goes beyond all fame

And the cry of my heart
Is to bring You praise
From the inside out
Lord my soul cries out
