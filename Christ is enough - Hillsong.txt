VERSE 1
Christ is my reward
And all of my devotion
Now there's nothing in this world
That could ever satisfy

PRE-CHORUS
Through every trial
My soul will sing
No turning back
I've been set free

CHORUS
Christ is enough for me
Christ is enough for me
Everything I need is in You
Everything I need

VERSE 2
Christ my all in all
The joy of my salvation
And this hope will never fail
Heaven is our home

PRE-CHORUS
Through every storm
My soul will sing
Jesus is here
To God be the glory

CHORUS
Christ is enough for me
Christ is enough for me
Everything I need is in You
Everything I need

BRIDGE 1 (2x)
I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back,
No turning back

BRIDGE 2 (2x)
The cross before me
The world behind me
No turning back,
No turning back

CHORUS (2x)
Christ is enough for me
Christ is enough for me
Everything I need is in You
Everything I need

BRIDGE 1 (4x)
I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back,
No turning back
