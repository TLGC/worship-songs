VERSE (2x)
A pure heart, that's what I long for
A heart that follows hard after Thee

VERSE 2 (P1)
A heart that hides Your Word
So that sin will not come in
A heart that's undivided
But one You rule and reign

VERSE 2 (P2)
A heart that beats compassion
That pleases You, my Lord
A sweet aroma of worship
That rises to Your throne
