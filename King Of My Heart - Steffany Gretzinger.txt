VERSE 1
Let the King of my heart be
The mountain where I run
The fountain I drink from; oh,
He is my song

Let the King of my heart be
The shadow where I hide
The ransom for my life; oh,
He is my song

CHORUS
‘Cause You are good
You're good, oh
You are good
You're good, oh
You are good
You're good, oh
You are good
You're good, oh


VERSE 2 (2x)
Let the King of my heart be
The wind inside my sails
The anchor in the waves; oh
He is my song

Let the King of my heart be
The fire inside my veins
The echo of my days; oh
He is my song

CHORUS
‘Cause You are good
You're good, oh
You are good
You're good, oh
You are good
You're good, oh
You are good
You're good, oh

Bridge (5x)
You’re never gonna let, never gonna let me down

CHORUS
‘Cause You are good
You're good, oh
You are good
You're good, oh
You are good
You're good, oh
You are good
You're good, oh

Bridge (5x)
You’re never gonna let, never gonna let me down
