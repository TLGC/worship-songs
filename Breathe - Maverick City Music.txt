VERSE 1
This goes out to the world
This goes out to the stressed
Sorting out a million thoughts
Running through your head
To everyone that's waiting
For better days ahead
Tired, and frustrated and leaving words unsaid
Please don't hold your breath

CHORUS
Just Breathe
Cause it's a miracle we can breathe
There's power in the way that we breathe
Release your heavy burdens
And let everything that has breath praise the Lord
This is why we have breath, to Praise the Lord

VERSE 2
Sometimes you are in the desert
Sometimes you feel the pain
Sometime He calms the storms and sometimes He let's it rain
Please don't hold your breath

CHORUS
Just Breathe
Cause it's a miracle we can breathe
There's power in the way that we breathe
Release your heavy burdens
And let everything that has breath praise the Lord
This is why we have breath, to Praise the Lord

CHORUS
Just Breathe
Cause it's a miracle we can breathe
There's power in the way that we breathe
Release your heavy burdens
And let everything that has breath praise the Lord
This is why we have breath, to Praise the Lord

ADLIBS
That means, I won't use it use it to complain
I won't use it to whine all day
I won't use it to hate

I have a better purpose for my breath
Am breathing to worship
Am breathing to believe
Am breathing to tell my testimony
Oh that's why I have breath

This is why we have breathe
To Praise the Lord
Any other use of it, is beneath it
So Praise the Lord
Some of the ways I've used it
I realised that they're not worth it
The reason am here today is to Praise the Lord
