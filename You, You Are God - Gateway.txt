VERSE 1
Here I am, I've come to find You
Here I am, to see Your grace

To bring to You an offering
I have to ask myself one thing
How can I do anything but praise,
I praise

CHORUS
You, You are God, You are Lord
You are all I'm living for
You are King of everything
I want my life to praise You

VERSE 2
Here I am, I've come to thank You
Here I am, a life You've changed

Because You gave Your life for me
You crucified Your Son for me
How can I do anything but praise,
I praise

CHORUS
You, You are God, You are Lord
You are all I'm living for
You are King of everything
I want my life to praise

CHORUS
You, You are God, You are Lord
You are all I'm living for
You are King of everything
I want my life to praise You

VERSE (INTERLUDE)

CHORUS
You, You are God, You are Lord
You are all I'm living for
You are King of everything
I want my life to praise You

TAG (END)
You are God, You are Lord
You are all I'm living for
You are King of everything
I want my life to praise You,
I want my life to praise You,
I want my life to praise You
