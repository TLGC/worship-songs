VERSE 1
Can’t go back to the beginning
Can’t control what tomorrow will bring
But I know here in the middle
Is the place where You promise to be

CHORUS
I’m not enough
Unless You come
Will You meet me here again
Cause all I want
Is all You are
Will You meet me here again

VERSE 2
As I walk now through the valley
Let Your love rise above every fear
Like the sun shaping the shadow
In my weakness Your glory appears

CHORUS (2x)
I’m not enough
Unless You come
Will You meet me here again
Cause all I want
Is all You are
Will You meet me here again

BRIDGE (2x)
Not for a minute
Was I forsaken
The Lord is in this place
The Lord is in this place
Come Holy Spirit
Dry bones awaken
The Lord is in this place
The Lord is in this place

CHORUS (2x)
I’m not enough
Unless You come
Will You meet me here again
Cause all I want
Is all You are
Will You meet me here again

BRIDGE
Not for a minute
Was I forsaken
The Lord is in this place
The Lord is in this place
Come Holy Spirit
Dry bones awaken
The Lord is in this place
The Lord is in this place
