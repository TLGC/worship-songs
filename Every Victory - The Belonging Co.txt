We will lift our eyes
We won’t fear the fight
There is one who’s stronger
Hard pressed on each side
We will not lose sight
Of the One who’s greater

One name, one name holds every victory
One voice that silences the enemy
One king who reigns for all eternity
Jesus, Jesus

Your power is revealed
Giants fall defeated
We are taking ground
Walls are falling down
In the mighty Name of Jesus

CHORUS
One name, one name holds every victory
One voice that silences the enemy
One king who reigns for all eternity
Jesus, Jesus
Jesus, Jesus

You rose, You reign

One voice that silences the enemy
One king who reigns for all eternity
Jesus, Jesus
