We are an altar of broken stones
But You delight in the offering
You have the heavens to call Your home
But You abide in the song we sing

Ten thousand angels surround Your throne
To bring You praise that will never cease
But hallelujah from here below
Is still Your favourite melody

CHORUS
We sing Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
We sing Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

CHORUS 2
We sing Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
We sing Hallelujah,

For here and now shall Your Kingdom reign
