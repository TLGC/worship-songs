VERSE 1
Overwhelmed but I won’t break
Through the battle I will say
Your grace will be enough
Your grace will be enough

VERSE 2
Under fire but we won’t fall
We will never be alone
You’ll always be enough
You’ll always be enough

CHORUS
Now in God we trust
In His Name we hope
I know God will not be shaken
God is here with us
He’s already won
I know God will not be shaken

VERSE 3
We will follow where You go
We will trust through the unknown
I know You go before
I know You go before

VERSE 4
Lead my heart now in Your ways
For we’re carrying Your Name
Your promise never fails
Your promise never fails

CHORUS
Now in God we trust
In His Name we hope
I know God will not be shaken
God is here with us
He’s already won
I know God will not be shaken

BRIDGE (2x)
You finish what You begun
Forever strong in Your love
Your Name is sure
And You will fight for us
Our hope forever secure
In You alone

CHORUS
Now in God we trust
In His Name we hope
I know God will not be shaken
God is here with us
He’s already won
I know God will not be shaken

God will not be shaken
