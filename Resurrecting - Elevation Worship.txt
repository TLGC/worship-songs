VERSE 1
The head that once was crowned with thorns
Is crowned with glory now
The Saviour knelt to wash our feet
Now at His feet we bow

The one who wore our sin and shame
Now robed in majesty
The radiance of perfect love
Now shines for all to see

Is victory
All praise
Will rise
To Christ our King

To him who is our peace
His final breath upon the cross
Is now alive in me

By Your spirit I will rise
From the ashes of defeat
The resurrected King
Is resurrecting me

In Your name I come alive
To declare Your victory
The resurrected King
Is resurrecting me

The tomb where soldiers watched in vain
Was borrowed for three days
His body there would not remain
Our God has robbed the grave
Our God has robbed the grave
