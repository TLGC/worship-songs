VERSE 1
King of kings, majesty,
God of Heaven living in me,
gentle Saviour, closest friend,
strong deliverer, beginning and end,
all within me falls at Your throne.

CHORUS
Your majesty, I can but bow,
I lay my all before You now.
In royal robes I don't deserve
I live to serve Your majesty

VERSE 2
Earth and Heaven worship You,
love eternal, faithful and true,
who bought the nations, ransomed souls,
brought this sinner near to Your throne;
all within me cries out in praise.

CHORUS
Your majesty, I can but bow,
I lay my all before You now.
In royal robes I don't deserve
I live to serve Your majesty

CHORUS
Your majesty, I can but bow,
I lay my all before You now.
In royal robes I don't deserve
I live to serve Your majesty

END
I live to serve Your majesty
