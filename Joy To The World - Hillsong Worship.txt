VERSE 1
Joy to the world the Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing

VERSE 2
Joy to the world the Saviour reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
Rocks hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy

CHORUS
We will sing joy
We will sing joy
We will sing joy
Joy to the world

VERSE 3
He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love

CHORUS
We will sing joy
We will sing joy
We will sing joy
Joy to the world
