VERSE 1
I cast my mind to Calvary
Where Jesus bled and died for me
I see His wounds His hands His feet
My Saviour on that cursed tree

VERSE 2
His body bound and drenched in tears
They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb
The entrance sealed by heavy stone
Messiah still and all alone

CHORUS
Oh praise the Name of the Lord our God
Oh praise His Name forevermore
For endless days we will sing Your praise
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God

VERSE 3
Then on the third at break of dawn
The Son of heaven rose again
Oh trampled death where is your sting?
The angels roar for Christ the King

CHORUS
Oh praise the Name of the Lord our God
Oh praise His Name forevermore
For endless days we will sing Your praise
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God

CHORUS
Oh praise the Name of the Lord our God
Oh praise His Name forevermore
For endless days we will sing Your praise
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God

VERSE 4
He shall return in robes of white
The blazing sun shall pierce the night
And I will rise among the saints
My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face

CHORUS (2x)
Oh praise the Name of the Lord our God
Oh praise His Name forevermore
For endless days we will sing Your praise
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God
