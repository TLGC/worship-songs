VERSE 1
Salvation sounds a new beginning
As distant hearts begin believing
Redemption's bid is unrelenting
Your love goes on
Your love goes on

CHORUS
You carry us
Carry us
When the world gives way
You cover us
Cover us
With Your endless grace

CHORUS2
Your love is relentless
Your love is relentless
Your love is relentless
Your love is relentless

VERSE 2
The time is up for chasing shadows
You gave the world a light to follow
A hope that shines beyond tomorrow
Your love goes on
Your love goes on

BRIDGE
Tearing through the veil of darkness
Breaking every chain You set us free
Fighting for the furthest heart You gave
Your life for all to see
