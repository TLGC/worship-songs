VERSE 1
There was a moment when the lights went out
When death had claimed its victory
The King of love had given up His life
The darkest day in history

VERSE 2
There on a cross they made for sinners
For every curse His blood atoned
One final breath and it was finished
But not the end we could have known

PRE-CHORUS 1
For the earth began to shake
And the veil was torn
What sacrifice was made
As the heavens roared

CHORUS
All hail King Jesus
All hail the Lord of Heaven and earth
All hail King Jesus
All hail the Saviour of the world

VERSE 2
There was a moment when the sky lit up
A flash of light breaking through
When all was lost He crossed eternity
The King of life was on the move

PRE-CHORUS 2
For in a dark, cold tomb
Where our Lord was laid
One miraculous breath
And weâ€™re forever changed

CHORUS
All hail King Jesus
All hail the Lord of Heaven and earth
All hail King Jesus
All hail the Saviour of the world

CHORUS
All hail King Jesus
All hail the Lord of Heaven and earth
All hail King Jesus
All hail the Saviour of the world

BRIDGE
Let every knee come bow before the King of Kings
Let every tongue confess that He is Lord
Lift up your shout, let us join with all of Heaven
Singing Holy, singing Holy
Singing Holy, singing Holy

CHORUS
All hail King Jesus
All hail the Lord of Heaven and earth
All hail King Jesus
All hail the Saviour of the world

CHORUS 1
What a beautiful Name it is
What a beautiful Name it is
The Name of Jesus Christ my King
What a beautiful Name it is
Nothing compares to this
What a beautiful Name it is
The Name of Jesus

CHORUS 3
What a powerful Name it is
What a powerful Name it is
The Name of Jesus Christ my King
What a powerful Name it is
Nothing can stand against
What a powerful Name it is
The Name of Jesus

BRIDGE
Death could not hold You
The veil tore before You
You silence the boast of sin and grave
The heavens are roaring
The praise of Your glory
For You are raised to life again

You have no rival
You have no equal
Now and forever God You reign
Yours is the kingdom
Yours is the glory
Yours is the Name above all names
