VERSE 1
Nothing can separate
Even if I ran away
Your love never fails

VERSE 2
I know I still make mistakes
But You have new mercies for me everyday
Your love never fails

CHORUS
You stay the same through the ages
Your love never changes
There maybe pain in the night but joy comes in the morning

VERSE 4
And when the oceans rage
I don't have to be afraid
Because I know that You love me
Your love never fails

VERSE 5
The wind is strong and the water's deep
But I'm not alone in these open seas
Cause Your love never fails

PRE-CHORUS
The chasm is far too wide
I never thought I'd reach the other side
But Your love never fails

CHORUS
'Cause You stay the same through the ages
Your love never changes
There maybe pain in the night but joy comes in the morning

VERSE 4
And when the oceans rage
I don't have to be afraid
Because I know that You love me

BRIDGE (6x)
You make, all things, work together for my good.

CHORUS
'Cause You stay the same through the ages
Your love never changes
There maybe pain in the night but joy comes in the morning

CHORUS 2
And when the oceans rage
I don't have to be afraid
Because I know that You love me
