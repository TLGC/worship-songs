King of my heart
King of my soul
You are the One that I live for
No other Name
No other throne
It's You alone

VERSE 2
King of my heart
King of my soul
I'll make a joyful surrender
No other Name
No other throne
It's You alone

PRE-CHORUS
So let my life be undivided God
King of my soul
King of my soul

CHORUS
Forever You are seated on the throne
And forever You are good above it all
King of my soul

VERSE 1
King of my heart
King of my soul
You are the One that I live for
No other Name
No other throne
It's You alone

PRE-CHORUS
So let my life be undivided God
King of my soul
King of my soul

Forever You are seated on the throne
And forever You are good above it all

This will be a joyful surrender
This will be my anthem forever
This will be a joyful surrender

Forever You are seated on the throne
And forever You are good above it all
King of my soul
