VERSE 1
Thank You for the cross, Lord
Thank You for the price You paid
Bearing all my sin and shame
In love You came and gave amazing grace

VERSE 2
Thank You for this love, Lord
Thank You for the nail pierced hands
Washed me in Your cleansing flow
Now all I know Your forgiveness and embrace

CHORUS
Worthy is the lamb
Seated on the throne
crown You now with many crowns
You reign victorious

CHORUS
High and lifted up
Jesus, Son of God
The Darling of Heaven crucified
