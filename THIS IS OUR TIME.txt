There's a sound breaking out, Lord for all that You've done
And now we're turning, our turning our hearts to You
And no we'll never stop, never stop loving You

This will be the best time of our lives
As we encounter Your love again
Here with You our hearts will come alive
As we declare Your praises
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
As we declare Your praises
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Ev'ry heart set apart just to be where You are
And now we're turning our, turning our hearts to You
And no we'll never stop, never stop loving You
