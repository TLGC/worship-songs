CHORUS
For You alone deserve all glory
For You alone deserve all praise
Father we worship and adore You
Father we long to see Your face

For You alone deserve all glory
For You alone deserve all praise
Father we love You
And we worship You this day

VERSE
You are the peace that guards my heart
My help in times of need
You are the hope that leads me on
And brings me to my knees

For there I find You waiting
And there I find relief
So with all my heart I'll worship
And unto You I'll sing
 
CHORUS
For You alone deserve all glory
For You alone deserve all praise
Father we worship and adore You
Father we long to see Your face

For You alone deserve all glory
For You alone deserve all praise
Father we love You
And we worship You this day
