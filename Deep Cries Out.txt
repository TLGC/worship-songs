I’ve got a river of living water
a fountain that never will run dry
It’s an open heaven You’re releasing
and we will never be denied

PRE-CHORUS (1)
Cause we’re stirring up deep deep wells
We’re stirring up deep deep waters
We’re gonna dance in the river
Dance in the river

PRE-CHORUS (2)
Cause we’re stirring up deep deep wells,
We’re stirring up deep deep waters
We’re gonna jump in the river,
Jump in the river

CHORUS (2x)
Deep cries out to deep cries out to,
deep cries out to deep cries out to
So we cry out to, we cry out to, You Jesus

BRIDGE
We’re falling into deeper waters, calling out to You
We’re walking into deeper waters, gonna after You

BRIDGE
It's all about Jesus tonight

TAG
If He goes to the left then we’ll go to the left
If He goes to the right then we’ll go to the right
We’re gonna Jump Jump Jump Jump in the river
Jump Jump Jump Jump everybody

BRIDGE
We’re gonna Dance Dance, Dance Dance in the river
Dance Dance, Dance Dance Everybody
We’re gonna Shout Shout Shout in the river
Shout Shout Shout in the river Everybody
