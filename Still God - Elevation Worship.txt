VERSE 1
Until the storm has ceased
Your voice will rise above the seas
We will not fear
You are still God
Here in the waters deep
Your hand will always be beneath
We will not fear
You are still God

CHORUS
We lift our eyes to You, Most High
Forever be exalted
Forever, You will be exalted
Our help will come from You, Most High
Forever be exalted
Forever, You will be exalted

VERSE 2
And beyond eternity
You reign with all authority
And now You're near
You are with us
Impossibility
Remains no longer when You speak
And now You're near
You are with us

CHORUS
We lift our eyes to You, Most High
Forever be exalted
Forever, You will be exalted
Our help will come from You, Most High
Forever be exalted
Forever, You will be exalted

BRIDGE
Before the world began
It wasn't spoken yet
You were still God
And You are still God
After Your final breath
It wasn't over yet
You were still God
And You are still God

Before the world began
It wasn't spoken yet
You were still God
And You are still God
No weapon formed against
Has stopped Your promises
You were still God
And You are still God
You were still God
And You are still God

CHORUS
We lift our eyes to You, Most High
Forever be exalted
Forever, You will be exalted
Our help will come from You, Most High
Forever be exalted
Forever, You will be exalted

CHORUS
We lift our eyes to You, Most High
Forever be exalted
Forever, You will be exalted
Our help will come from You, Most High
Forever be exalted
Forever, You will be exalted
