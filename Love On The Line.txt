[Verse 1]
You put Your love on the line
To bear the weight of sin that was mine
Washing my river of wrongs
Into the sea of Your infinite love

[Chorus]
With arms held high
Lord I give my life
Knowing I'm found in Christ
In Your love forever
With all I am
In your grace I stand
The greatest of all romance
Love of God my Saviour
(Oh You're my Saviour, Jesus)
[Verse 2]
Mercy roars like hurricane winds
Furious love laid waste to my sin

[Chorus]
With arms held high
Lord I give my life
Knowing I'm found in Christ
In Your love forever
With all I am
In your grace I stand
The greatest of all romance
Love of God my Saviour
(Oh your love Jesus)

Come on we sing to the One

[Bridge]
To the One who has rescued my soul
To the One who has welcomed me home
To the One who is Saviour of all
I sing forever
To the One who has rescued my soul
To the One who has welcomed me home
To the One who is Saviour of all
I sing forever

(Oh we sing to you Jesus, Jesus)

[Chorus]
With arms held high
Lord I give my life
Knowing I'm found in Christ
In Your love forever
With all I am
In your grace I stand
The greatest of all romance
Love of God my Saviour

[Bridge]
To the One who has rescued my soul
To the One who has welcomed me home
To the One who is Saviour of all
I sing forever
To the One who has rescued my soul
To the One who has welcomed me home
To the One who is Saviour of all
I sing forever
