VERSE
For the praises of man
I will never ever stand
For the kingdoms of this world
I'll never give my heart away
Oh shout my praise

My allegiance and devotion
My heart's desire and all emotion
Go to serve the Man
Who died upon that tree

CHORUS
Only a God like You
Could be worthy of my praise
And all my hope and faith
To only a King of all kings
Do I bow my knee and sing
Give my everything

CHORUS
Only a God like You
Could be worthy of my praise
And all my hope and faith
To only a King of all kings
Do I bow my knee and sing
Give my everything

To only my Maker my Father my Saviour
Redeemer Restorer Rebuilder Rewarder
To only a God like You
Do I give my praise
