I'm a part of the promise, so I count the stars in the heavens
And number all of my descendants, as I'm crying out for redemption
For a chosen generation

I'm a part of Your promise, so I count the stars in the heavens
And number all of my descendants, as I'm crying out for redemption
For a chosen generation

Your blessing is in family
You take pleasure in your people
I hear a cry from heaven
Saying you will bear much fruit

BRIDGE (3x)
La la la la la la
Singing la la la la la la

VERSE 2
I'm a part of the promise, so I count the stars in the heavens
And number all of my descendants, as I'm crying out for redemption
For a chosen generation, For a thousand generations, For a thousand generations

VERSE (3x)
May His favour be upon you
And a thousand generations
And your families and your children
And their children, and their children

VERSE
May His presence go before you
And behind you, and beside you
All around you, and within you
He is with you, He is with you

In the morning, in the evening
In your coming, and your going
In your weeping, and rejoicing
He is for you, He is for you

He is for you, He is for you
He is for you, He is for you
He is for you, He is for you

May His favour be upon you
And a thousand generations
And your families and your children
And their children, and their children

The Lord bless you
And keep you
Make His face shine upon you
And be gracious to you
The Lord turn His
Face toward you
And give you peace

Make His face shine upon you
And be gracious to you
The Lord turn His
Face toward you
And give you peace
