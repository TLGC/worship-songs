VERSE 1
In the quiet, in the stillness
I know that You are God
In the secret of Your Presence
I know there I am restored

PRE-CHORUS
When You call I won't refuse
Each new day, again I'll choose

CHORUS
There is no one else for me
None but Jesus
Crucified to set me free
Now I live to bring Him praise

VERSE 2
In the chaos, in confusion
I know You're sovereign still
In the moment of my weakness
You give me grace to do Your Will

PRE-CHORUS
When You call I won't delay
This my song through all my days

CHORUS
There is no one else for me
None but Jesus
Crucified to set me free
Now I live to bring Him praise
There is no one else for me
None but Jesus
Crucified to set me free
Now I live to bring Him praise

BRIDGE (2x)
All my delight is in You, Lord
All of my hope, all of my strength
All my delight is in You, Lord
Forevermore

CHORUS (2x)
There is no one else for me
None but Jesus
Crucified to set me free
Now I live to bring Him praise
