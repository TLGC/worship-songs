VERSE 1
I love You, Lord
And I lift my voice
To worship You
Oh, my soul rejoice!
Take joy my King
In what You hear
Let it be a sweet, sweet sound
Let it be a sweet, sweet sound
Let it be a sweet, sweet sound
In Your ear.

VERSE 2
All I have is Yours
Take my life Jesus
Let my heart sing
How I love You, Lord
How I need You, Jesus
Who I am, who I have, Jesus

VERSE
I love You (ooohhhh...)

VERSE 3
You're brighter than the sun
Risen from the shadows
Seated on the throne of majesty
Higher than the skies and all we see
