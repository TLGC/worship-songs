VERSE 1
I lay my life down at Your feet
Cause You're the only one I need
I turn to You and You were always there
In troubled times it's You I seek
I put You first that's all I need
I humble all I am, All to You

CHORUS
One way
Jesus
You're the only one that I could live for
One Way
Jesus
You're the only one that I could live for

VERSE 2
You were always, always there
Every how and everywhere
Your grace abounds so deeply within me
You will never ever change
Yesterday today the same
Forever till forever meets no end

CHORUS
One way
Jesus
You're the only one that I could live for
One Way
Jesus
You're the only one that I could live for

BRIDGE (2x)
You are the way the truth and the life
We live by faith and not by sight for You
We're living all for You


CHORUS (2x)
One way
Jesus
You're the only one that I could live for
One Way
Jesus
You're the only one that I could live for
