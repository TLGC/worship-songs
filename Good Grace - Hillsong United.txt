VERSE 1
People come together
Strange as neighbours
Our blood is one
Children of generations
Of every nation
Of kingdom come

CHORUS
Don’t let your heart be troubled
Hold your head up high
Don’t fear evil
Fix your eyes on this one truth
God is madly in love with you
Take courage hold on
Be strong, remember where our help comes from

TAG (interlude)

VERSE 2
Jesus, our redemption
Our salvation
Is in His blood

Jesus, light of heaven
Friend forever
His kingdom come

CHORUS
Don’t let your heart be troubled
Hold your head up high
Don’t fear evil
Fix your eyes on this one truth
God is madly in love with you
Take courage hold on
Be strong, remember where our help comes from

TAG (interlude)

BRIDGE (3x)
Swing wide, all you heavens
Let the praise go up, as the walls come down
All creation, everything with breath
Repeat the sound
All His children,
Clean hands,
Pure hearts,
Good grace,
Good God
His Name is Jesus
