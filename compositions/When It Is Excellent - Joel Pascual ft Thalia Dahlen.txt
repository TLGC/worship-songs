VERSE 1
NO WEAPON FORMED AGAINST ME
CAN STAND UP TO YOUR NAME 
SHOULD DARKNESS OVERWHELM ME 
I’LL RESIST STAND FIRM IN FAITH 

VERSE 2 
TEMPTED BUT NOT DEFEATED
STRUCK DOWN BUT NOT DESTROYED
LORD JESUS ALWAYS FOR ME 
HE CANT STOP FOREVERMORE 

CHORUS
AND I, 
AM DELIVERED FROM THE NIGHT 
LET YOUR PEOPLE GLORIFY 
THE NAME ABOVE ALL NAMES 

IS LIFTED HIGH 
WE’RE REDEEMED 
OH GLORY WE’RE REDEEMED
THROUGH YOUR AUTHORITY
THERE’S NO STOPPING GOD

VERSE 3
WHEN TRIALS SPEAK DECEPTION 
OUR TRIUMPH SPEAKS YOUR NAME 
YOUR PEACE TRANSCENDS THE BURDENS 
IN VICTORY YOU REIGN 

TEMPTED BUT NOT DEFEATED 
STRUCK DOWN BUT NOT DESTROYED 
LORD JESUS ALWAYS FOR ME 
HE CANT STOP FOREVERMORE 

CHORUS
AND I, 
AM DELIVERED FROM THE NIGHT 
LET YOUR PEOPLE GLORIFY 
THE NAME ABOVE ALL NAMES 

IS LIFTED HIGH 
WE’RE REDEEMED 
OH GLORY WE’RE REDEEMED
THROUGH YOUR AUTHORITY
THERE’S NO STOPPING GOD
