VERSE 1
I’ll praise in the valley
Praise on the mountain

I’ll praise when I’m sure
Praise when I’m doubting

VERSE 2
I’ll praise when outnumbered
Praise when surrounded

Cause praise is the waters
My enemies drown in

PRE-CHORUS & CHORUS
As long as I’m breathing
I’ve got a reason to

Praise the Lord, oh my soul
Praise the Lord, oh my soul

VERSE 3
I’ll praise when I feel it
I’ll praise when I don’t

I’ll praise cause I know
You’re still in control

VERSE 4
My praise is a weapon
It’s more than a sound

My praise is the shout
That brings Jericho down

PRE-CHORUS & CHORUS
As long as I’m breathing
I’ve got a reason to

Praise the Lord, oh my soul
Praise the Lord, oh my soul

CHORUS 2
I won’t be quiet
My God is alive

How could I keep it inside
Praise the Lord oh my soul

BRIDGE 1
I’ll praise cause You’re sovereign
Praise cause You reign

Praise cause You rose
And defeated the grave

BRIDGE 2
I’ll praise cause You’re faithful
Praise cause You’re true

Praise cause there’s nobody
Greater than You

BRIDGE 1
I’ll praise cause You’re sovereign
Praise cause You reign

Praise cause You rose
And defeated the grave

BRIDGE 2
I’ll praise cause You’re faithful
Praise cause You’re true

Praise cause there’s nobody
Greater than You

CHORUS
Praise the Lord, oh my soul
Praise the Lord, oh my soul

Praise the Lord, oh my soul
Praise the Lord, oh my soul

CHORUS 2
I won’t be quiet
My God is alive
How could I keep it inside

CHORUS 2
I won’t be quiet
My God is alive
How could I keep it inside

CHORUS 2
I won’t be quiet
My God is alive

How could I keep it inside
Praise the Lord, oh my soul

REFRAIN
Let everything
That has breath
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord
