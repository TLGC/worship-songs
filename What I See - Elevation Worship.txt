Do you see what I see?
Do you see what I see?

VERSE
I see lightning, I hear thunder
Something stirring six feet under
Dead things coming back to life again
I believe there's about to be another resurrection

I see signs and I see wonders
I see bursts of living colour
Dead things coming back to life again
I believe thereâ€™s about to be another resurrection

CHORUS
Come alive
Wake up, sleeper
He is risen
We are risen with Him

VERSE 2
Hallelujah, it is finished
See that grave, no body in it
Dead things coming back to life again
I believe there's about to be another resurrection

CHORUS
Come alive
Wake up, sleeper
He is risen
We are risen with Him
Paradise
Flung wide open
He is risen
We are risen with Him

BRIDGE
If you see what I see
That the grave is empty
Then you know what I know
Anything is possible

If you see what I see
That the grave is empty
Then you know what I know
Anything is possible

Do you see what I see?
Do you see what I see?
Do you see what I see?

I see signs and I see wonders
Do you see what I see?
I see lightning, I hear thunder
Do you see what I see?
Something stirring six feet under

CHORUS
Come alive
Wake up, sleeper
He is risen
We are risen with Him
Paradise
Flung wide open
He is risen
We are risen with Him

CHORUS
Come alive
Wake up, sleeper
He is risen
We are risen with Him
Paradise
Flung wide open
He is risen
We are risen with Him
