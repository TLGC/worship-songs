My Saviour,
Redeemer,
Lifted me from the miry clay
Almighty,
Forever,
I will never be the same,
Cause You came near,
From the everlasting,
To the world we live,
The Father's only Son

CHORUS
You lived
And You died
And You rose again on high
And You opened the way for the world to live again
Hallelujah, for all You've done
