VERSE 1
You spoke those words
Let there be light
And there was oh
And in that same breath
The stars fell in line
With one voice creation cries
You do all things well
You do all things well

CHORUS
Be praised
Be praised
Forever and always

VERSE 2
Lost in the dark up under the dirt
I was buried left to die
And I heard Your voice calling my name
From the tomb I came alive
You do all things well
From the tomb I came alive
You do all things well

CHORUS
Be praised, be praised
Be praised, be praised
Be praised, be praised
Forever and always

BRIDGE
When I think of all You’ve done and all the battles You’ve brought me over Hallelujah
And all the storms I saw You calm in my defense my only song is Hallelujah
And how He never let me fall now unto Him who is able Hallelujah
And let there never be a day that I don’t rise to bring You praise
Hallelujah hallelujah

CHORUS
Be praised, be praised
Be praised, be praised
Be praised, be praised
Forever and always
