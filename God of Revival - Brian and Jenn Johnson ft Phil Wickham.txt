VERSE 1
We’ve seen what You can do, oh God of wonders
Your power has no end
The things You’ve done before in greater measure
You will do again

PRE-CHORUS
There’s no prison wall You can’t break through
No mountain You can’t move
All things are possible
There’s no broken body You can’t raise
No soul that You can’t save
All things are possible

CHORUS
The darkest night
You can light it up
You can light it up
Oh God of revival
Let hope arise
Death is overcome
You’ve already won
Oh God of revival

VERSE 2
You rose in victory and now You’re seated
Forever on the throne
So why should my heart fear what You defeated
I will trust in You alone

PRE-CHORUS
There’s no prison wall You can’t break through
No mountain You can’t move
All things are possible
There’s no broken body You can’t raise
No soul that You can’t save
All things are possible

CHORUS
The darkest night
You can light it up
You can light it up
Oh God of revival
Let hope arise
Death is overcome
You’ve already won
Oh God of revival

BRIDGE
Come awaken Your people, come awaken this city
Oh God of revival pour it out, pour it out
Every stronghold will crumble, I hear the chains hit the ground
Oh God of revival pour it out, pour it out

BRIDGE
Come awaken Your people, come awaken this city
Oh God of revival pour it out, pour it out
Every stronghold will crumble, I hear the chains hit the ground
Oh God of revival pour it out, pour it out

CHORUS
The darkest night
You can light it up
You can light it up
Oh God of revival
Let hope arise
Death is overcome
You’ve already won
Oh God of revival

BRIDGE
Come awaken Your people, come awaken this city
Oh God of revival pour it out, pour it out
Every stronghold will crumble, I hear the chains hit the ground
Oh God of revival pour it out, pour it out

INTERLUDE
Oo – oh oo – oh, God of revival
