VERSE 1
All my words fall short, I got nothing new
How could I express all my gratitude

VERSE 2
So I could sing these songs, as I often do
But every song must end and You never do

CHORUS 1
So I throw up my hands, and praise You again and again
'Cause all that I have is a hallelujah, hallelujah
And I know it's not much, but I've nothing else fit for a king
Except for a heart singing hallelujah, hallelujah

VERSE 3
I've got one response, I've got just one move
With my arms stretched wide, I will worship You

CHORUS 1
So I throw up my hands, and praise You again and again
'Cause all that I have is a hallelujah, hallelujah
And I know it's not much, but I've nothing else fit for a king
Except for a heart singing hallelujah, hallelujah

BRIDGE 1
So come on my soul, oh don't you get shy on me
Lift up your song, 'cause you've got a lion
Inside of those lungs, get up and praise the Lord

BRIDGE 2
Come on my soul, oh don't you get shy on me
Lift up your song, 'cause you've got a lion
Inside of those lungs, get up and praise the Lord

BRIDGE 3
Come on my soul, oh don't you get shy on me
Lift up your song, 'cause you've got a lion
Inside of those lungs, get up and praise the Lord, hey

INSTRUMENTAL

Praise the Lord, praise the Lord

CHORUS 2
So I throw up my hands and praise You again and again
'Cause all that I have is a hallelujah, hallelujah
And I know it's not much, but I've nothing else fit for a king
Except for a heart singing hallelujah, hallelujah
