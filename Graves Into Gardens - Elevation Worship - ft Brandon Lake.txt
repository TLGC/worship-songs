VERSE 1
I searched the world
But it couldn’t fill me
Man’s empty praise
and treasures that fade
Are never enough

VERSE 2
Then You came along
And put me back together
And every desire is now satisfied
Here in Your love

CHORUS
Oh there’s nothing better than You
There’s nothing better than You
Lord there’s nothing,
Nothing is better than You

VERSE 3
I’m not afraid
To show You my weakness
My failures and flaws
Lord You’ve seen them all
And You still call me friend

VERSE 4
‘Cause the God of the mountain
Is the God of the valley
There’s not a place
Your mercy and grace
Won’t find me again

CHORUS
Oh there’s nothing better than You
There’s nothing better than You
Lord there’s nothing,
Nothing is better than You

CHORUS
Oh there’s nothing better than You
There’s nothing better than You
Lord there’s nothing,
Nothing is better than You

BRIDGE
You turn mourning to dancing
You give beauty for ashes
You turn shame into glory
You’re the only one who can

BRIDGE
You turn mourning to dancing
You give beauty for ashes
You turn shame into glory
You’re the only one who can

BRIDGE 2
You turn graves into gardens
You turn bones into armies
You turn seas into highways
You’re the only one who can
You’re the only one who can

CHORUS
Oh there’s nothing better than You
There’s nothing better than You
Lord there’s nothing,
Nothing is better than You

CHORUS
Oh there’s nothing better than You
There’s nothing better than You
Lord there’s nothing,
Nothing is better than You

You turn mourning to dancing
You give beauty for ashes
You turn shame into glory
You’re the only one who can

You give beauty for ashes
You turn shame into glory
You’re the only one who can

You’re the only one who can
