I can't contain
And I can't control
I want more of You God
I want more of You God

No place I would rather be
No place I would rather be
Than here in Your love, here in Your love

I want more, I want more
I want more, I want more
won't You pour it out

And I can't control
I want more of You God
I want more of You God
