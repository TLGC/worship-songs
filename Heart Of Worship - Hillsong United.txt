VERSE 1
When the music fades
All is stripped away
And I simply come

Longing just to bring
Something that's of worth
That will bless Your heart

PRE-CHORUS
I'll bring You more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what You have required

You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart

CHORUS
I'm coming back to the heart of worship
And it's all about You
It's all about You, Jesus

I'm sorry Lord for the thing I've made it
When it's all about You
It's all about You, Jesus

VERSE 2
King of endless worth
No one could express
How much You deserve

Though I'm weak and poor
All I have is Yours
Every single breath

PRE-CHORUS
I'll bring You more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what You have required

You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart

CHORUS (2x)
I'm coming back to the heart of worship
And it's all about You
It's all about You, Jesus

I'm sorry Lord for the thing I've made it
When it's all about You
It's all about You, Jesus
