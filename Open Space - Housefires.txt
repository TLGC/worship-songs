VERSE 1
Pull me in closer, close to Your heart
May I be a pure reflection of all You are
Love that is patient, love that is kind
And love that keeps no offenses or wrongs in my mind
Make me like Jesus
Make me like Jesus

CHORUS (2x)
My heart is an open space
For You to come and have Your way
I am open, I am open

VERSE 2
You're faithful to find me, right where I am
Though even in my wandering, You call me friend
And mercy receives me and lifts me to my feet
And I'm caught up in the wonder and mystery
I'll know when Jesus
I'll know when Jesus

CHORUS (2x)
My heart is an open space
For You to come and have Your way
I am open, I am open

BRIDGE 1 (2x)
Do whatever You wanna do
And say whatever You wanna say
And move however You wanna move
And change whatever You wanna change

CHORUS (2x)
My heart is an open space
For You to come and have Your way
I am open, I am open

BRIDGE 2 (6x)
What are You saying? Where are You going?
My heart is open wide and my eyes are open wide

CHORUS (2x)
My heart is an open space
For You to come and have Your way
I am open, I am open
