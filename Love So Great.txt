VERSE 1
Your love so great
Jesus in all things
I’ve seen a glimpse of Your heart
A billion years
Still I’ll be singing
How can I praise You enough

CHORUS
You are the Lord Almighty
Out shining all the stars in glory
Your love is like the wildest ocean
Oh nothing else compares

Creation calls
All to the Saviour
We are alive for Your praise
In earth and sky no one is higher
Our God of wonders You reign,
Our God of wonders You reign

CHORUS
You are the Lord Almighty
Out shining all the stars in glory
Your love is like the wildest ocean
Oh nothing else compares

CHORUS
You are the Lord Almighty
Out shining all the stars in glory
Your love is like the wildest ocean
Oh nothing else compares

Not to us
But to Your Name
We lift up
All praise

CHORUS
You are the Lord Almighty
Out shining all the stars in glory
Your love is like the wildest ocean
Oh nothing else compares

CHORUS
You are the Lord Almighty
Out shining all the stars in glory
Your love is like the wildest ocean
Oh nothing else compares

BRIDGE (4x)
Not to us
But to Your Name
We lift up
All praise

You are the Lord Almighty
Out shining all the stars in glory
Your love is like the wildest ocean
Oh nothing else compares

You are the Lord Almighty
Out shining all the stars in glory
Your love is like the wildest ocean
Oh nothing else compares
