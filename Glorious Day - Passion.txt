VERSE 1
I was buried beneath my shame
Who could carry that kind of weight
It was my tomb
'Till I met You

VERSE 2
I was breathing, but not alive
All my failures I tried to hide
It was my tomb
'Till I met You

CHORUS
You called my name
And I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness
Into Your glorious day

CHORUS
You called my name
And I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness
Into Your glorious day

VERSE 3
Now Your mercy has saved my soul
Now Your freedom is all that I know
The old made new
Jesus, when I met You

Pre-Chorus
When You called my name
And I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness
Into Your glorious day

CHORUS
You called my name
And I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness
Into Your glorious day

BRIDGE
I needed rescue
My sin was heavy
But chains break at the weight of Your glory
I needed shelter
I was an orphan
But You call me a citizen of heaven
When I was broken
You were my healing
Your love is the air that I'm breathing
I have a future
My eyes are open

CHORUS
When You called my name
And I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness
Into Your glorious day

CHORUS
You called my name
And I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness
Into Your glorious day
