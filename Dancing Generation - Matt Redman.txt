VERSE 1
Your mercy taught us how to dance
To celebrate with all we have
And we’ll dance to thank You for mercy
Your glory taught us how to shout
We’ll lift Your name in all the earth
And we’ll shout to the praise of Your glory

PRE-CHORUS
It’s the overflow of a forgiven soul
And now we’ve seen You, God
Our hearts cannot stay silent

CHORUS
And we’ll be a dancing generation
Dancing because of Your great mercy, Lord
Your great mercy, Lord

And we’ll be a shouting generation
Shouting because of Your great glory, Lord
Your great glory, Lord
