CHORUS (4x)
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me

VERSE 1
Here I am
Here I stand
Lord, my life is in Your hands
Lord, I'm longing to see
Your desires revealed in me

CHORUS (2x)
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me

VERSE 2
Take my heart
Take my life
As a living sacrifice
All my dreams all my plans
Lord I place them in Your hands

CHORUS (4x)
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me

BRIDGE (7x)
My life is not my own
To You I belong
I give myself,
I give myself to You
