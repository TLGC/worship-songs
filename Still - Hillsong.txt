VERSE 1
Hide me now
Under Your wings
Cover me
Within Your mighty hand

CHORUS
When the oceans rise and thunders roar
I will soar with You above the storm
Father, You are King over the flood
I will be still and know You are God

VERSE 3
Find rest my soul
In Christ alone
Know His power
In quietness and trust

CHORUS (2x)
When the oceans rise and thunders roar
I will soar with You above the storm
Father, You are King over the flood
I will be still and know You are God

VERSE 3
Find rest my soul
In Christ alone
Know His power
In quietness and trust

CHORUS (3x)
When the oceans rise and thunders roar
I will soar with You above the storm
Father, You are King over the flood
I will be still and know You are God
