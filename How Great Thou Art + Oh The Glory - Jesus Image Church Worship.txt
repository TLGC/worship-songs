VERSE 1
Oh Lord, my God, when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout the universe displayed

CHORUS
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art


VERSE 1
Jesus all glorious
prepare in us Your temple
Called as living stones
Where You're enthroned
As You rose from death in power
So rise within our worship
Rise upon our praise
And let the hand that saw You raised
Clothe us in Your glory
Draw us by Your grace

CHORUS
Oh the glory of Your presence
We Your temple give You reverence
Come and rise from Your rest
And be blessed by our praise
As we glory in Your embrace
As Your presence now fills this place


TAG (OPTIONAL END)
Come and rise from Your rest
And be blessed by our praise
As we glory in Your embrace
As Your presence now fills this place
This holy place
