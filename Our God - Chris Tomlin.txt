VERSE 1
Water You turned into wine
Opened the eyes of the blind
There's no one like You
None like You

VERSE 2
Into the darkness, You shine
Out of the ashes, we rise
There's no one like You
None like You

CHORUS
Our God is greater, our God is stronger
God, You are higher than any other
Our God is healer, awesome in power
Our God, our God

VERSE 2
Into the darkness, You shine
Out of the ashes, we rise
There's no one like You
None like You

Our God, our God

Our God is greater, our God is stronger

Our God is healer, awesome in power
Our God, our God

And if our God is with us, then what could stand against
Then what could stand against
