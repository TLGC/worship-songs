CHORUS
Come alive come alive come alive dry bones
Come alive come alive come alive dry bones
Awake arise
Inhale the light
Come alive come alive

VERSE 1
I’m gonna sing to you dry bones
Until you’re covered in life
And the valley blooms
Like a rosebud in the light

VERSE 2
Hear the call to attention
Feel the change in the air
For the ground is dry
But the clouds are overhead

PRE-CHORUS
I’m gonna sing it again

CHORUS
Come alive come alive come alive dry bones
Come alive come alive come alive dry bones
Awake arise
Inhale the light
Come alive come alive

VERSE 3
Are you waiting on heaven
Or is it waiting on you
For the Holy Ghost is already in the room

VERSE 4
So you better get ready
‘Cause who knows what He’ll do
Where the four winds blow there’s a
breakthrough breaking through

PRE-CHORUS 2
I’m gonna prophesy again

CHORUS
Come alive come alive come alive dry bones
Come alive come alive come alive dry bones
Awake arise
Inhale the light
Come alive come alive

POST-CHORUS
Come alive, alive
Get up and rise, rise

BRIDGE
So leave those shackles in the grave now
And dance like you were young
You do not have to live in chains now
There’s a key within your song

So leave the past where it belongs child
And take a leap into the Light
Find the freedom you were born for
And tell that soul to rise
Arise arise arise

Get up and rise, rise

I’ll sing it again

CHORUS
Come alive come alive come alive dry bones
Come alive come alive come alive dry bones
Awake arise
Inhale the light
Come alive come alive

POST-CHORUS
Come alive come alive,
Come alive come alive,
Come alive

Up from the ashes
A new life is born,
Up from the ashes
Flesh on the bone
