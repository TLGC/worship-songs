VERSE 1
So here it is, my alabaster heart
I’m keeping nothing back from who You are
No hidden treasure veiled by key or lock
You’re a lifetime worth of worship
And that’s only just the start

VERSE 2
Here it is, my every waking day
The minutes, hours, the years of endless praise
For You’re worthy far beyond all I could say
There’s a lifetime worth of worship
In the nuance of Your names

CHORUS
Let it rise like incense
My whole life a fragrance
Every ounce here broken at Your feet

Every breath an offering
My heart cries these lungs sing
Over You, my worthy King of Kings

VERSE 3
There it is, Your alabaster cross
Giving all You are for all I’m not
I can’t believe that’s the kind of King You are
How could I not bring a lifetime worth of worship to You God

CHORUS (2x)
Let it rise like incense
My whole life a fragrance
Every ounce here broken at Your 

Every breath an offering
My heart cries these lungs sing
Over You, my worthy King of Kings

BRIDGE (3x)
All my love
All my love
All my love
You can have it all

All my love
All my love
All my love
You can have it all

All my heart
All my soul
All I own
You can have it all

All my heart
All my soul
All I own
You can have it all


You can have it all

CHORUS
Let it rise like incense
My whole life a fragrance
Every ounce here broken at Your feet

Every breath an offering
My heart cries these lungs sing
Over You, my worthy King of Kings

TAG (ALT CHORUS)
Let it rise like incense
My whole life a fragrance
Every ounce here spilled out at Your feet

Every breath is my offering
My heart cries these lungs sing
Over You, my worthy King of Kings

TAG
You’re worthy of it all
