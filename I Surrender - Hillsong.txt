VERSE 1
Here I am
Down on my knees again
Surrendering all,
Surrendering all

VERSE 2
Find me here
Lord as You draw me near
I'm desperate for You,
I'm desperate for You

CHORUS
I surrender

VERSE 3
Drench my soul
As mercy and grace unfold
I hunger and thirst
I hunger and thirst

VERSE 4
With arms stretched wide
I know You hear my cry
Speak to me now,
Speak to me now

CHORUS
I surrender
I surrender
I want to know You more
I want to know You more

I surrender
I surrender
I want to know You more
I want to know You more

BRIDGE
Like a rushing wind
Jesus breathe within
Lord have Your way
Lord have Your way in me
Like a mighty storm
Stir within my soul
Lord have Your way
Lord have Your way in me

Like a rushing wind
Jesus breathe within
Lord have Your way
Lord have Your way in me
Like a mighty storm
Stir within my soul
Lord have Your way
Lord have Your way in me
