VERSE
And now the weak say I have strength
By the spirit of power that raised Christ from the dead
And now the poor stand and confess
That my portion is You and I'm more than blessed

VERSE
Let now our hearts burn with a flame
A fire consuming all for Your Son's holy name
And with the heavens we declare
You are our king

PRE-CHORUS
We love You Lord, we worship You
You are our God, You alone are good

CHORUS
We love You Lord, we worship You
You are our God, You alone are good
You asked Your Son to carry this
The heavy cross, our weight of sin

VERSE
Let now Your church shine as Your bride
That You soar in Your heart as You offered up Your life
Let now the lost be welcomed home
By the saved and redeemed those adopted as Your own

VERSE
Let now our hearts burn with a flame
A fire consuming all for Your Son's holy name
And with the heavens we declare
You are our king

CHORUS
We love You Lord, we worship You
You are our God, You alone are good
You asked Your Son to carry this
The heavy cross, our weight of sin

I love You Lord, I worship You
Hope which was lost, now stands renewed
I give my life to honor this
The love of Christ, the savior king

VERSE
Let now our hearts burn with a flame
A fire consuming all for Your Son's holy name
And with the heavens we declare
You are our king, for You we sing

You are our God, You alone are good)

You asked Your Son to carry this
The heavy cross, our weight of sin

Hope which was lost, now stands renewed
I give my life to honor this
The love of Christ, the savior king
