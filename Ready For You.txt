VERSE 1
Here we are
Standing on the edge of something new
Lead us on
Further than we've ever been before

PRE-CHORUS
With hands held high
Be glorified
Our hearts now cry

CHORUS
We are living for 
The glory of the Lord
Hearts are open wide
We're ready for You
There's nothing we want more
You're all that we adore
Jesus, here we are
Ready for You

VERSE 2
Where You are
Freedom reigns for Christ has set us free
We decide
To leave our fears behind for liberty

PRE-CHORUS
With hands held high
Be glorified
Our hearts now cry

CHORUS
We are living for 
The glory of the Lord
Hearts are open wide
We're ready for You
There's nothing we want more
You're all that we adore
Jesus, here we are
Ready for You

Ready for You

PRE-CHORUS (3x)
With hands held high
Be glorified
Our hearts now cry

CHORUS (2x)
We are living for 
The glory of the Lord
Hearts are open wide
We're ready for You
There's nothing we want more
You're all that we adore
Jesus, here we are
Ready for You
