My Father I adore You more
Than anything my heart could wish for
I just want You
And Jesus my beloved Saviour
Everything I am I owe to You
I owe it all to You

VERSE 2
And angels come and adore You
And we Your children worship You

CHORUS
You are my world
You are my God
And I lay down my life for You
You are my Lord
The one I love
No one could ever take Your place

VERSE 3
And everything I have I give to You
My Lord, the One I live for
I live for You
And all my days are gifts from You
I pray Id use them as You want me to
Use them for You

VERSE 2
And angels come and adore You
And we Your children worship You

CHORUS
You are my world
You are my God
And I lay down my life for You
You are my Lord
The One I love
No one could ever take Your place
