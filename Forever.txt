TITLE
FOREVER

VERSE 1
The moon and stars they wept
The morning sun was dead
The Saviour of the world was fallen
His body on the cross
His blood poured out for us
The weight of every curse upon Him

VERSE 2
One final breath He gave
As Heaven looked away
The Son of God was laid in darkness
A battle in the grave
The war on death was waged
The power of hell forever broken

PRE-CHORUS
The ground began to shake
The stone was rolled away
His perfect love could not be overcome
Now death where is your sting?
Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated

CHORUS
Forever, He is glorified
Forever, He is lifted high
Forever, He is risen
He is alive
He is alive

PRE-CHORUS
The ground began to shake
The stone was rolled away
His perfect love could not be overcome
Now death where is your sting?
Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated

CHORUS (2x)
Forever, He is glorified
Forever, He is lifted high
Forever, He is risen
He is alive
He is alive

BRIDGE (6x)
We sing Hallelujah
We sing Hallelujah
We sing Hallelujah
The Lamb has overcome

CHORUS (2x)
Forever, He is glorified
Forever, He is lifted high
Forever, He is risen
He is alive
He is alive
