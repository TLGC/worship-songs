VERSE 1
Who else would rocks cry out to worship
Whose glory taught the stars to shine
Perhaps creation longs to have the words to sing
But this joy is mine

CHORUS
With a thousand hallelujahs
We magnify Your Name
You alone deserve the glory
The honour and the praise
Lord Jesus this song is forever Yours
A thousand hallelujahs
And a thousand more

Verse 2
Who else would die for our redemption
Whose resurrection means I’ll rise
There isn’t time enough to sing of all You’ve done
But I have eternity to try

CHORUS
With a thousand hallelujahs
We magnify Your Name
You alone deserve the glory
The honour and the praise
Lord Jesus this song is forever Yours
A thousand hallelujahs
And a thousand more

BRIDGE

To the Lamb
To the King of heaven
Praise for He rose
Now He reigns
We will sing forever

A thousand hallelujahs
And a thousand more
