CHORUS
There is joy in the Lord
There is love in His Spirit
There is hope in the knowledge of Him
There's a fountain that flows
Like a river from heaven
Abounding in love to my soul

VERSE
All blessing and honour are His
All glory and power are His
Let all wisdom and strength
Be the Lord's in this place
Let all glory be given to Him

CHORUS
There is joy in the Lord
There is love in His Spirit
There is hope in the knowledge of Him
There's a fountain that flows
Like a river from heaven
Abounding in love to my soul

VERSE
All blessing and honour are His
All glory and power are His
Let all wisdom and strength
Be the Lord's in this place
Let all glory be given to Him

CHORUS
There is joy in the Lord
There is love in His Spirit
There is hope in the knowledge of Him
There's a fountain I know
Every time I am near it
My heart overflows to the Lord

CHORUS
There is joy in the Lord
There is love in His Spirit
There is hope in the knowledge of Him

CHORUS
There is joy in the Lord
There is love in His Spirit
There is hope in the knowledge of Him
There's a fountain that flows
Like a river from heaven
Abounding in love to my soul

END
It's abounding in love to my soul
It's abounding in love to my soul
