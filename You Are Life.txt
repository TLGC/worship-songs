VERSE 1
You have come
And we have found life
Everlasting
Now alive
To know
Your freedom
Never ending

PRE-CHORUS
You alone have made a way for us
In Your love
You are life

CHORUS
I’m living in the light of my Saviour
Dancing in the arms of forever
I’m singing like I’m walking on water
You are life
Alive in me

VERSE 2
From greyest skies
To living colour
You have called us
In Your life
Your light uncovered
The world to see now

PRE-CHORUS
You alone have made a way for us
In Your love
You are life

CHORUS
I’m living in the light of my Saviour
Dancing in the arms of forever
I’m singing like I’m walking on water
You are life
Alive in me

I give my life to follow
‘Cause Your love is all I want now
You are life
You are life
Alive in me

BRIDGE
For all the world to find Your love
For all the world to see that You are God
Forever be lifted high
The One who holds the universe
And every beating heart across the earth
Jesus be lifted high
You are life

CHORUS
I’m living in the light of my Saviour
Dancing in the arms of forever
I’m singing like I’m walking on water
You are life
Alive in me

POST–CHORUS
I give my life to follow
‘Cause Your love is all I want now
You are life
You are life
Alive in me
