The world turns in all of its ways
But I'm soul set on a holy name
And when all earth is said and done
Still I will praise Him

There's no end to the love that He gives
And now broken dreams have a life again
In the hope of the risen King
let's praise Him

PRE-CHORUS
A mystery unthinkable
That He took the fall just to save my soul
Now to love is the life I know
On and on and on we'll be singin'

CHORUS
Soul set free in the One I love
Come on, come on
And let the whole earth sing
In the freedom we know
Come on, come on and praise Him

VERSE 4
Come come all the lost and the found
Let us rise up with a holy sound
All the earth unified as one
Just to praise Him

VERSE 5
In full view with nothing to hide
Like a city on a hill we're gonna shine
In the light of Your freedom
Let's praise Him

PRE-CHORUS
A mystery unthinkable
That He took the fall just to save my soul
Now to love is the life I know
On and on and on we'll be singin'

CHORUS (2x)
Soul set free in the One I love
Come on, come on
And let the whole earth sing
In the freedom we know
Come on, come on and praise Him
