VERSE 1
There’s a light
That shines with hope and grace
Fills the sky
With new mercy each day
We’re alive
Let your glory pour out Jesus

There’s a joy
That overwhelms our souls
Cause we know
Our God is in control
Overflow
Let your favour pour out Jesus

CHORUS
This is the day that the Lord has made
We will rejoice and be glad in it
This is the day that the lord has made
We’ll rejoice
We’ll rejoice
And be glad in it
We’ll rejoice
We’ll rejoice
And be glad in it
