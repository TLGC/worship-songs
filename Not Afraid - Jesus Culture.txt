VERSE 1
I have this confidence because
I've seen the faithfulness of God
The still inside the storm, the promise of the shore

I trust the power of Your word
Enough to seek Your Kingdom first
Beyond the barren place, beyond the ocean waves

CHORUS
When I walk through the waters, I won't be overcome
When I go through the rivers, I will not be drowned
My God will make a way, so I am not afraid

VERSE 2
You keep the promises You make
There isn't one that is delayed
So I will not lose heart, here, I will lift my arms

And start to sing into the night
My praise will call the sun to rise
Declare the battle won, declare that it is done

CHORUS 2
When I walk through the waters, I won't be overcome
When I go through the rivers, I will not be drowned
My God will make a way, so I am not afraid

When I am in the fire, I will not feel the flame
I'll stand before the giant, declaring victory
My God will make a way, so I am not afraid

BRIDGE
Before me, behind me, always beside me
No shadow, no valley, where You won't find me
No, I am not afraid

Before me, behind me, always beside me
No shadow, no valley, where You won't find me
No, I am not afraid
I am not afraid

CHORUS 2
When I walk through the waters, I won't be overcome
When I go through the rivers, I will not be drowned
My God will make a way, so I am not afraid

When I am in the fire, I will not feel the flame
I'll stand before the giant, declaring victory
My God will make a way, so I am not afraid
My God will make a way, so I am not afraid

BRIDGE
Before me, behind me, always beside me
No shadow, no valley, where You won't find me
No, I am not afraid

Before me, behind me, always beside me
No shadow, no valley, where You won't find me
No, I am not afraid
I am not afraid

CHORUS 2
When I walk through the waters, I won't be overcome
When I go through the rivers, I will not be drowned
My God will make a way, so I am not afraid

When I am in the fire, I will not feel the flame
I'll stand before the giant, declaring victory
My God will make a way, so I am not afraid
