VERSE 1
It all revolves
Around Your throne
Who can know Your glory
So high above
Yet slain for us
You alone are worthy

CHORUS
And the praise is Yours
And the praise is Yours
You're the One we bow before
Reigning over us
As we lift You up
You will reign forevermore

VERSE 2
The One who was
And is to come
God of every moment
Forever crowned
Exalted now
You alone are holy

CHORUS (2x)
And the praise is Yours
And the praise is Yours
You're the One we bow before
Reigning over us
As we lift You up
You will reign forevermore

BRIDGE (3x)
Glory and praise
Power and strength
Worthy is the Lamb of God
Hallelujah

CHORUS (2x)
And the praise is Yours
And the praise is Yours
You're the One we bow before
Reigning over us
As we lift You up
You will reign forevermore

BRIDGE
Glory and praise
Power and strength
Worthy is the Lamb of God
Hallelujah

END
It all revolves
Around Your throne
Who can know Your glory
