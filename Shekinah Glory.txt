VERSE 1
We wait for You, we wait for You
We wait for You; walk in the room

VERSE 2
Here we are, standing in Your presence
Here we are, standing in Your presence
Shekinah glory come down, Shekinah glory come down

CHORUS
Release the fullness of Your Spirit
Shekinah glory come, Shekinah glory come

VERSE 3
You move and we want more, You speak and we want more
You move and we want more; we want the fullness

BRIDGE
We want more, we want more, we want more, we want more
We want more, we want more, more of Your Spirit
