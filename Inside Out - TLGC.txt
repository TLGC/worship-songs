VERSE
You won the war against all sin
Restored and cleansed is deep within
You gave Your life
Our debts was paid

PRE-CHORUS
You made a way to You oh God
We are free
We are healed by Your
blood

CHORUS
We are the new creation,
We are changed from the inside out,
You died on the cross as our Saviour
And we will shout And we will shout

VERSE
Alpha and Omega, King of kings
Above everything,
You are God of all creation,
though Him all things consist
Above everything,
You are

END
Oh Jesus,
Jesus Jesus You are
