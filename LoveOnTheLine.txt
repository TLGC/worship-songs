VERSE 1
You put Your love on the line
To bear the weight of sin that was mine
Washing my river of wrongs
Into the sea of Your infinite love

CHORUS
With arms held high
Lord I give my life
Knowing I'm found in Christ
In Your love forever
With all I am
In Your grace I stand
The greatest of all romance
Love of God my Saviour


VERSE 2
Mercy roars like hurricane winds
Furious love laid waste to my sin

CHORUS
With arms held high
Lord I give my life
Knowing I'm found in Christ
In Your love forever
With all I am
In Your grace I stand
The greatest of all romance
Love of God my Saviour

BRIDGE (2x)
To the One who has rescued my soul
To the One who has welcomed me home
To the One who is Saviour of all
I sing forever

CHORUS
With arms held high
Lord I give my life
Knowing I'm found in Christ
In Your love forever
With all I am
In Your grace I stand
The greatest of all romance
Love of God my Saviour

BRIDGE (2x)
To the One who has rescued my soul
To the One who has welcomed me home
To the One who is Saviour of all
I sing forever
