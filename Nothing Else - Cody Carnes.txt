CHORUS
I'm caught up in Your presence  
I just want to sit here at Your feet
I'm caught up in this holy moment
I never want to leave 

Oh, I'm not here for blessings 
Jesus, You don't owe me anything
More than anything that You can do
I just want You  

Verse 1
I'm sorry when I've just gone through the motions
I'm sorry when I just sang another song
Take me back to where we started
I open up my heart to You
  
Verse 2
I'm sorry when I've come with my agenda
I'm sorry when I forgot that You're enough
Take me back to where we started
I open up my heart to You
 
Chorus
I'm caught up in Your presence
I just want to sit here at Your feet
I'm caught up in this holy moment
I never want to leave

Oh, I'm not here for blessings

Jesus, You don't owe me anything
More than anything that You can do
I just want You

BRIDGE
I just want You
Nothing else, nothing else
Nothing else will do

I just want You
Nothing else, nothing else
Nothing else will do
