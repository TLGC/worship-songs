I will sing of your goodness
I will sing of your love
Though the seasons come quickly,
You have always been enough.

Though the night may get darker
Though the waiting seems long,
You have always been faithful
To remind me of your love.

You are good,
You are good to me

Standing firm upon your truth,

You are good to me
