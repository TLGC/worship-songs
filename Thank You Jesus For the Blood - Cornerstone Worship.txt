VERSE 1
I was a wretch
I remember who I was
I was lost I was blind
I was running out of time
Sin separated
The breach was far too wide
But from the far side of the chasm
You held me in Your sight

VERSE 2
So You made a way
Across the great divide
Left behind Heaven's throne
To build it here inside
And there at the cross
You paid the debt I owed
Broke my chains
Freed my soul
For the first time I had hope

CHORUS
Thank You Jesus
For the blood applied
Thank You Jesus
It has washed me white
Thank You Jesus
You have saved my life
Brought me from the darkness
Into glorious light

VERSE 3
You took my place
Laid inside my tomb of sin
You were buried for three days
But then You walked right out again
And now death has no sting
And life has no end
For I have been transformed
By the blood of the Lamb

CHORUS
Thank You Jesus
For the blood applied
Thank You Jesus
It has washed me white
Thank You Jesus
You have saved my life
Brought me from the darkness
Into glorious light

BRIDGE (2X)
There is nothing stronger
Than the wonder working power
Of the blood the blood
That calls us sons and daughters
We are ransomed by our Father
Through the blood, the blood

CHORUS
Thank You Jesus
For the blood applied
Thank You Jesus
It has washed me white
Thank You Jesus
You have saved my life
Brought me from the darkness
Into glorious light

BRDIGE 2a
You've given me life
You've opened my eyes
I love You Lord
I love You Lord

BRIDGE 2b
You've entered my heart
You've set me apart
I love You Lord
I love You Lord

TAG
I exalt thee
I exalt thee
I exalt thee
O Lord

OUTRO
Glory to His name
Glory to His name
There to my heart
Was the blood applied
Glory to His name
