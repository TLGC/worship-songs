VERSE 1
Yours will be the only Name that matters to me
The only One Whose favour I seek
The only Name that matters to me

VERSE 2
Yours will be
The friendship and affection I need
To feel my Father smiling on me
The only Name that matters to me

PRE-CHORUS
Yours is the Name the Name that has saved me
Mercy and grace the power that forgave me
And Your love is all I’ve ever needed

VERSE 1
Yours will be the only Name that matters to me
The only One Whose favour I seek
The only Name that matters to me

PRE-CHORUS
Yours is the Name the Name that has saved me
Mercy and grace the power that forgave me
And Your love is all I’ve ever needed

BRIDGE (2x)
When I wake up in the Land of Glory
And with the saints I will tell my story
There will be one Name that I proclaim

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, just that Name

BRIDGE (2x)
When I wake up in the Land of Glory
And with the saints I will tell my story
There will be one Name that I proclaim
