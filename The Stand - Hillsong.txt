VERSE 1
You stood before creation
Eternity in Your hand
You spoke the earth into motion
My soul now to stand

VERSE 2
You stood before my failure
And carried the cross for my shame
My sin weighed upon Your shoulders
My soul now to stand

CHORUS
So what could I say?
And what could I do?
But offer this heart, Oh God
Completely to You

VERSE 4
So I'll walk upon salvation
Your Spirit alive in me
This life to declare Your promise
My soul now to stand

CHORUS
So what could I say?
And what could I do?
But offer this heart, Oh God
Completely to You

BRIDGE
I'll stand
With arms high and heart abandoned
In awe of the One who gave it all
I'll stand
My soul Lord to You surrendered
All I am is Yours
