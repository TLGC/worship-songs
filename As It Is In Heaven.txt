Verse 1
Whether now or then
Death is not my end
I know heaven waits for me
Though the road seems long
I’ll never walk alone
I’ve got all I need to sing

Pre-Chorus
I know You love me
I know You found me
I know You saved me
And Your grace will never fail me
And while I’m waiting
I’m not waiting
I know heaven lives in me

Verse 2
Should I suffer long
This is not my home
I know heaven waits for me
Though the night is dark
Heaven owns my heart
I’ve got all I need to sing

Chorus
So I will sing like I will there
In the fearless light of glory
Where the darkness cannot find me
And Your face is all I see
I will sing like a man
With no sickness in my body
Like no prison walls can hold me
I will sing like I am free

Bridge 1
I’ll sing holy holy
My heart cries holy
As it is in heaven
It is in me

Bridge 2
We’ll sing holy holy
The earth cries holy
As it is in heaven
So let it be
