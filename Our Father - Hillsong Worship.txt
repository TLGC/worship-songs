VERSE 1
The words of Christ
Passed down through generations
The Son of God teaching us to pray
Echoed words
Father have Your will, Your way in me
Completely

VERSE 2
We wholly trust
You're faithful in provision
Amazing grace, mercy for our sins
May we forgive
The way that You've forgiven us, oh Lord
So we can sing

CHORUS
Our Father
Hallowed be Your Name
Forever our God be exalted
Your kingdom come and in us
Let Your will Be done,
Our Father

VERSE 3
Lead us from the valley of temptation
Deliver us from the evil one
Lord You reign and here we stand
Victorious in Your Name
Together we pray

CHORUS
Our Father
Hallowed be Your Name
Forever our God be exalted
Your kingdom come and in us
Let Your will Be done,
Our Father

Forever and always and always
