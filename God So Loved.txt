CHORUS
For God so loved the world
That He gave His only Son
Whosoever believes
Will not perish
They shall have eternal life

VERSE 1
I shall hold
To the cross
I shall hold
To God alone

For His love
Has salvaged me
For His love
Has set me free

CHORUS
For God so loved the world
That He gave His only Son
Whosoever believes
Will not perish
They shall have eternal life

VERSE 
I shall wait
Upon the Lord
I shall wait
Upon His Word

By His grace
I am released
By His grace
I am redeemed

BRIDGE
By His precious blood
I have been set free
For the glory of Jesusâ€™ Name

I surrender all
Now to Christ alone
In Jesus I am saved
