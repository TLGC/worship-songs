VERSE 1
I lift my eyes to see Your face
I know my help is in Your Name
In everything
Held by hands
Of mercy

PRE-CHORUS
And I will run and not grow weary
I will rise in God my strength
My heart will trust
For all my hope
Is Christ alone

CHORUS
Now my soul sings
Your love it knows no end
Your love it knows no end
Your love it knows no end

VERSE 2
I will love for You have loved
I will forgive as You forgive
Your love prevails
You fill my life
With hope again

CHORUS (2x)
Now my soul sings
Your love it knows no end
Your love it knows no end
Your love it knows no end

BRIDGE (3x)
You reign forever
You reign forever
You are the light unto this world

CHORUS (3x)
Now my soul sings
Your love it knows no end
Your love it knows no end
Your love it knows no end
